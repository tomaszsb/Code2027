## üö® **WEEK 1: IMMEDIATE PRIORITY (40 hours)**

### **Day 1 (8 hours) - Quick Wins**
1. **Story content display fix** (30 minutes)
   - Files: `SpaceExplorerPanel.tsx:495`, `PlayerStatusItem.tsx:501`
   - Change: `content_text` ‚Üí `story`
   - Impact: 54 enhanced stories instantly visible

2. **OWNER-FUND-INITIATION UX fix** (4 hours)
   - Remove meaningless dice roll button
   - Add automatic funding logic
   - Impact: Eliminates major user confusion

3. **Cleanup duplicate file** (15 minutes)
   - Remove `PlayerStatusItem_backup.tsx`
   - Impact: Code cleanliness

4. **Start TurnService logging** (3.25 hours)
   - Connect to existing `logToActionHistory()`
   - Impact: Enhanced debugging visibility

### **Day 2-3 (16 hours) - Logging Infrastructure**
- Connect CardService, PlayerActionService, MovementService
- Add missing action types
- Impact: Complete player activity visibility via GameLog UI

### **Day 4-5 (16 hours) - Code Quality Foundation**
- Shared mock utilities (10 hours)
- Theme/color constants (6 hours)  
- Impact: Cleaner maintainable codebase

**Week 1 Success Criteria:**
