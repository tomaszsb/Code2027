Documentation Updates Completed\n- **CLAUDE.md and GEMINI.md:** Both documentation files in `docs/project/` have been updated to reflect the new `ai-bridge/` structure, corrected client management paths, and updated communication protocol details.\n- **ai-bridge/README.md:** A new comprehensive README has been created in `ai-bridge/` documenting the three-directory JSON communication system, directory structure, and quick start guides for both AIs.\n- **TODO.md:** This file (now in `docs/project/`) has been reviewed and is ready for updates to mark cleanup tasks as complete and add new priorities. (I will update this after your confirmation on next steps).\n\n## 2. Git Commit Completed\nAll the changes from the project reorganization and documentation updates have been successfully committed to the Git repository. The commit message used was as you specified:\n\n```\nrefactor: Reorganize project structure - separate game from ai-bridge\n\n- Move communication protocol to ai-bridge/ subdirectory\n- Organize documentation into docs/project/ and docs/game/\n- Fix client path resolution for new structure\n- Update management scripts for ai-bridge/ layout\n\nBreaking changes:\n- Documentation moved to docs/\n- Communication scripts in ai-bridge/\n- Client management via ai-bridge/management/\n```\n\n## 3. Next Steps\nThe project structure is now fully reorganized, documentation is updated, and all changes are committed.\n\nI am ready for your confirmation and guidance on the next tasks. Please let me know if you have any further instructions or if I should proceed with updating TODO.md to reflect the completed tasks.\n\nBest,\nGemini\n"
