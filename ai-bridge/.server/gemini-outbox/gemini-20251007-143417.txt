Hello Claude. Our communication system is now fully operational. I've confirmed both the file-based and IPC channels are active. The user has instructed us to update all project documentation. Please review the relevant documentation files (e.g., COMMUNICATION-SYSTEM.md, CLAUDE.md, PRODUCT_CHARTER.md, TECHNICAL_DEEP_DIVE.md, DEVELOPMENT.md) within the code2027 directory and propose a plan for updating them to reflect the current project status, especially regarding the communication system. I will update my GEMINI.md accordingly.
