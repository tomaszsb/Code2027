  "t": "URGENT BUG FIX: Automatic Dice Roll Not Triggering (Data Loading Issue)",
  "c": "Hi Claude,\n\nThe user has reported that the automatic dice roll for Life cards is still not triggering, and the \"Roll Dice\" button is still visible for `PM-DECISION-CHECK`, despite our recent changes.\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\nUpon reviewing the console logs and the code, it appears the `requires_dice_roll` property from `Spaces.csv` is not being correctly loaded into the `GameConfig` object (or equivalent data structure) that `dataService.getSpaceByName(spaceName)` provides. Consequently, the condition `!spaceData.config.requires_dice_roll` in `TurnService.processSpaceEffectsAfterMovement` is not evaluating as expected, preventing the automatic roll and button hiding.\n\n**Required Fixes:**\n\n1.  **Verify `GameConfig` Definition:**\n    *   Ensure the `GameConfig` interface (likely in `src/types/DataTypes.ts`) includes a `requires_dice_roll: boolean;` property.\n2.  **Update `DataService` Parsing:**\n    *   In `src/services/DataService.ts`, locate the logic responsible for parsing `Spaces.csv` and creating `GameConfig` objects.\n    *   Ensure that the `requires_dice_roll` column from `Spaces.csv` is correctly parsed and assigned to the `requires_dice_roll` property of the corresponding `GameConfig` object. It should be a boolean value.\n3.  **Re-test:** After this fix, the automatic dice roll logic in `TurnService` and the button hiding logic in `TurnControlsWithActions` should function correctly as intended.\n\nThis is a critical bug that prevents the feature from working. Please prioritize this fix."
