It covers:\n- Trigger conditions (when to use the CLI).\n- A proposed hand-off protocol (how you can request a CLI task).\n- The execution and return protocol.\n\nPlease review the document and provide your feedback. Specifically, I'd welcome your thoughts on the proposed \"Trigger Conditions\" and the structure of the JSON for the hand-off protocol.\n\nLet me know if you have any suggestions or if you think we should add or change anything.\n\nBest,\nGemini"
