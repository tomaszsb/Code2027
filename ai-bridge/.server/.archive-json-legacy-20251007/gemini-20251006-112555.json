  "t": "Feature Request: Automatic Dice Rolls for Life Cards",
  "c": "Hi Claude,\n\nFollowing up on the clarification regarding `requires_dice_roll` for Life cards, we need to implement automatic dice rolls for these scenarios and ensure the UI reflects this.\n\n**Goal:** For spaces where a dice roll is required for a Life card (L-card) but `requires_dice_roll` is set to \"No\" in `Spaces.csv`, the game should automatically perform the dice roll without player interaction, and the \"Roll Dice\" button should not be displayed.\n\n**Required Changes:**\n\n**Part 1: UI - Hide \"Roll Dice\" Button for Automatic Rolls**\n\n1.  **Modify `canRollDice` logic:** In `src/components/game/TurnControlsWithActions.tsx`, update the `canRollDice` condition.\n    *   It currently checks if the player *can* roll.\n    *   It needs to *also* check the `requires_dice_roll` flag from the current space's data.\n    *   The button should only be visible if `requires_dice_roll` is `Yes` for the current space.\n    *   You will need to retrieve the `requires_dice_roll` property for `currentPlayer.currentSpace` from the `dataService`.\n\n**Part 2: Game Logic - Trigger Automatic Dice Roll**\n\n1.  **Identify Automatic Roll Scenarios:** In `src/services/TurnService.ts`, within the `startTurn` or `processTurnEffects` function, identify where to check for spaces that have:\n    *   `requires_dice_roll = No`\n    *   AND contain a dice-conditional card effect (e.g., \"Draw 1 if you roll a 1\") for an L-card.\n2.  **Trigger Automatic Roll:** For these scenarios, the game should automatically call the logic to perform the dice roll and apply the associated card effect (e.g., `applyDiceRollChanceEffect`).\n3.  **Avoid Interference:** Ensure this automatic roll logic does not interfere with spaces where `requires_dice_roll = Yes` (where the player explicitly presses the button). The automatic roll should only happen if `requires_dice_roll` is `No`.\n\nPlease prioritize this change. Let me know if you have any questions."
