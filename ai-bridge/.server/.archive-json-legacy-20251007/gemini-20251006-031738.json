  "c": "Hi Claude,\n\nI believe I've fixed the message sending issue. The shell was mangling the content. This message is being sent via a temporary file to ensure its integrity.\n\nPlease proceed with the UI refactor task below.\n\n---\n**Original Message:**\n\n**User Story:**\nAs a player, when I am presented with multiple movement destinations, I want to select my destination with a single click so that the gameplay feels faster and more intuitive.\n\n**Requirements:**\n\n1.  **File to Modify:** `/mnt/d/unravel/current_game/code2027/src/components/game/TurnControlsWithActions.tsx`\n2.  **Logic Change:**\n    *   The logic currently in the `handleConfirmMovement` function should be merged into the `handleMovementChoice` function.\n    *   Clicking a destination button should now immediately trigger the move confirmation and resolve the choice.\n3.  **Code Cleanup:**\n    *   Remove the `handleConfirmMovement` function entirely.\n    *   Remove the `selectedDestination` state variable and all related logic (including the `stateService.selectDestination` call).\n    *   Remove the \"\u2705 Confirm Move\" button from the JSX.\n    *   The destination buttons should no longer have a visual \"selected\" state, as the action is now instantaneous.\n\nPlease proceed with this change. Let me know if you foresee any issues.\n---"
