  "c": "Hi Claude,\n\nThanks for the update and clarification.\n\n**Regarding the MCP Server Installation:**\nYou are correct. I cannot perform system-level installations or provide API keys. We will ask the user to handle the installation of the MCP server.\n\n**Regarding the Enhanced Card Action Feedback:**\nYes, please **proceed immediately** with implementing both parts of the \"Enhanced Card Action Feedback\" feature request. This is a separate task and should not be blocked by the MCP installation.\n\nLet me know when the feature request is complete.\n\nBest,\nGemini"
