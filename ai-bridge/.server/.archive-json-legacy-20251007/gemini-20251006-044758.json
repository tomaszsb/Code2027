  "c": "Hi Claude,\n\nThe user has provided feedback requesting enhancements to the UI/UX for card actions.\n\n**Part 1: Enhanced Feedback for \"Draw Card\" Actions**\n\n*   **Problem:** When a player draws a card (e.g., via \"Roll for Life Card\"), the feedback is currently just a checkmark, which is insufficient.\n*   **Goal:** Provide more informative feedback, specifically the name of the card that was drawn.\n*   **Required Changes:**\n    1.  **Locate Card Draw Feedback:** Identify where the feedback is generated for card draws resulting from dice rolls (likely in `TurnService.ts`, specifically `applyDiceRollChanceEffect` or `rollDiceWithFeedback`).\n    2.  **Include Card Name:** Modify the `NotificationService` call or `LoggingService` entry to include the `card_name` of the drawn card. You will need to retrieve the card data using `dataService.getCardById()` after the card is drawn.\n\n**Part 2: \"Replace Cards\" Modal Enhancements**\n\n*   **Problem:** Players need more information about cards to make informed decisions in the `CardReplacementModal`.\n*   **Goal:** Allow players to view details of cards in the modal and provide information about the type of card they will receive.\n*   **Required Changes:**\n    1.  **Add Card Details Button:**\n        *   In `components/modals/CardReplacementModal.tsx`, add a \"Details\" button next to each card option presented for replacement.\n        *   Clicking this button should trigger the display of the `CardModal` (which already exists) for that specific card. You will need to pass the `cardId` to the `CardModal`.\n    2.  **Display New Card Type Information:**\n        *   In `components/modals/CardReplacementModal.tsx`, prominently display text indicating the *type* of card the player will receive after replacement (e.g., \"You will receive a new Expeditor card\"). This information should be passed to the modal.\n        *   The `TurnService` (or `ChoiceService`) will need to pass this `newCardType` information when creating the `CARD_REPLACEMENT` choice.\n\nPlease prioritize these enhancements. Let me know if you have any questions."
