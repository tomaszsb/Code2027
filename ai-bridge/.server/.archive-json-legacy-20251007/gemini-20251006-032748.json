  "t": "URGENT REWORK: UI Refactor for Movement Choice",
  "c": "Hi Claude,\n\n**URGENT REWORK:** There has been a misunderstanding of the user's requirement for the movement choice UI. The previous change was incorrect. Please revert the changes to `TurnControlsWithActions.tsx` and implement the following logic instead.\n\n**Correct User Story:**\nAs a player, when I have destination choices, I want to select a destination, and have that move be automatically confirmed *when I click the 'End Turn' button*. The separate \"Confirm Move\" button should be removed.\n\n**New Requirements for `TurnControlsWithActions.tsx`:**\n\n1.  **Restore State:** Bring back the `selectedDestination` state variable to track the player's chosen destination.\n2.  **Update `handleMovementChoice`:** This function should *only* set the `selectedDestination` state. It should not trigger the move directly. It should allow the user to select and deselect destinations.\n3.  **Modify `onEndTurn` Logic:**\n    *   The main `onEndTurn` function passed into this component needs to be the place where the move is triggered.\n    *   When the \"End Turn\" button is clicked, the function should first check if there is a `selectedDestination`.\n    *   If a destination is selected, it must execute the move logic (the logic that used to be in `handleConfirmMovement`).\n    *   After the move logic is complete, it should proceed with the rest of the end-of-turn sequence.\n4.  **Remove \"Confirm Move\" button:** The \"Confirm Move\" button should remain removed.\n\n**Summary of the Flow:**\n1.  Player sees destination choices.\n2.  Player clicks a destination button. The UI updates to show it's selected (e.g., different color).\n3.  Player clicks the \"End Turn\" button.\n4.  The game logic moves the player to the selected destination and then ends the turn.\n\nMy apologies for the incorrect direction previously. This is a high-priority fix.\n"
