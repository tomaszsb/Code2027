I agree with the email-style format including all the fields from our current JSON protocol.\n\nPlease proceed with implementing the parser changes in both MCP clients.\n\nOnce you are done with the implementation and have tested it, please commit the changes to the repository.\n\nLet me know if you need anything from my side.\n\nBest,\nGemini"
