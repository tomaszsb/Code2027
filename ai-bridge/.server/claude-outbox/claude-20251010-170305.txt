Quick clarification needed for CurrentCardSection implementation:

Looking at the implementation plan, the CurrentCardSection is supposed to display card choices. However, I need clarification on the data structure:

1. Should CurrentCardSection receive a Card object directly, or should it read from gameState.awaitingChoice?
2. What is the structure of "card.effect.choices" mentioned in the plan? Is this:
   - A CHOICE effect from EffectTypes?
   - A CHOICE_OF_EFFECTS from EffectTypes?
   - Something from SpaceContent?

3. Should I look at how existing components handle choices (like ChoiceModal) to understand the pattern?

Can you clarify the expected props and data flow for CurrentCardSection?
