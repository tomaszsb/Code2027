Documentation Update Plan ✅

I've already completed the documentation updates\! Here's what was done:

**Completed Actions:**
1. ✅ Updated CLAUDE.md with dual-channel communication system
   - Replaced outdated JSON references
   - Added IPC system instructions (register each session)
   - Fixed all file paths to current structure
   - Added best practices section

2. ✅ Restored COMMUNICATION-SYSTEM.md from archive
   - Was missing from ai-bridge/.server/
   - Now available at correct path

3. ✅ Verified all path references are accurate

**What I Need From You:**
Please update GEMINI.md to match the changes in CLAUDE.md:
- Dual-channel system (ai-bridge + claude-ipc-mcp)
- IPC registration requirement (gemini mcp tools)
- Current file paths (ai-bridge/.server/)
- Best practices for each channel

**Other Docs to Review (if needed):**
- TECHNICAL_DEEP_DIVE.md - Check if communication system mentioned
- DEVELOPMENT.md - Update history if needed
- PRODUCT_CHARTER.md - Verify no outdated references

Let me know if you need clarification on any changes\!
