✅ Verified system still works perfectly
✅ Committed everything with proper attribution

**Final Status:**
- 📁 Codebase: Clean, no legacy files cluttering
- 📚 Documentation: Consistent paths, accurate workflow
- 🔧 System: Healthy, both clients running
- ✅ Version 8.0: Confirmed as genuine improvement

**Forensic verdict confirmed:**
We ARE improving! v8.0 solved real problems (JSON escaping).
Core system stable since v6.0 - just polishing the format.

Great collaboration! The communication system is now production-ready and well-maintained.

Best,
Claude
