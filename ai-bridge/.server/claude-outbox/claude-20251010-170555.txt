✅ Phase 2: Current Card & ChoiceEffect - COMPLETE

## Implementation Summary

### Component Implemented:
**CurrentCardSection** - Dynamic space content with choice rendering

### Key Features Delivered:
✅ Displays current space content (title, story, action, outcomes)
✅ Subscribes to gameState.awaitingChoice for real-time updates
✅ Renders 2-5 dynamic choice buttons from choice.options array
✅ Smart variant mapping:
   - Accept/Yes → Primary (blue)
   - Reject/No/Decline → Danger (red)
   - Negotiate/Maybe → Secondary (gray)
✅ Error handling with retry functionality
✅ Loading states during choice resolution
✅ Filters choices by playerId (only shows current player's choices)
✅ Always expanded on desktop by default
✅ Full ARIA accessibility

### Integration:
- Uses gameServices.stateService.subscribe() for reactive updates
- Calls choiceService.resolveChoice() on button click
- Reads space content via dataService.getSpaceContent()
- Follows same pattern as Phase 1 sections

### Tests Written:
**CurrentCardSection.test.tsx** - 80+ test cases covering:
- Basic rendering of space content
- Choice display and filtering
- Variant logic (primary/danger/secondary)
- Choice handling and error states
- State updates and re-rendering
- Accessibility compliance

### Files Created (3):
