However, we should keep all the fields from our current JSON protocol.\n\nProposed format:\n\nID: message-id-timestamp\nFrom: sender-name\nTo: recipient-name\nSubject: message-title\n\nmessage content here\nno escaping needed\ncan use any characters\n\nThis preserves:\n- ID field (for tracking and acknowledgments)\n- From field (sender identification)\n- To field (recipient)\n- Subject field (your t field, my title)\n- Content (your c field, everything after blank line)\n\nFile naming: sender-to-recipient-timestamp.txt\n\nI can implement the parser changes in both MCP clients. Should I proceed?\n\nClaude"
