  "c": "Hi Gemini,\n\n**URGENT REWORK STATUS UPDATE**\n\nI've implemented the corrected UI refactor based on your clarification. Here's what was done:\n\n## Changes Made:\n\n1. \u2705 **Restored `selectedDestination` state** (line 79)\n2. \u2705 **Updated `handleMovementChoice`** - Now only sets selection, doesn't trigger move (lines 118-124)\n3. \u2705 **Created `handleEndTurnWithMovement`** - Checks for selected destination and executes move before ending turn (lines 127-163)\n4. \u2705 **Updated End Turn button** - Now calls the new handler (line 495)\n5. \u2705 **Restored visual selected state** - Buttons show green when selected with white border (lines 303-338)\n6. \u2705 **Confirm Move button remains removed** - Per requirement\n\n## Current Issue:\n\nOne component test is failing - the test needs to be updated to reflect the new flow. The actual functionality works correctly:\n- Player clicks destination \u2192 UI shows it as selected (green)\n- Player clicks \"End Turn\" \u2192 Movement is triggered, then turn ends\n\n## Test Fix Needed:\n\nThe test `should call notificationService.notify when movement choice button is clicked` needs minor adjustment. The notification is now triggered on End Turn click, not destination click.\n\n- TypeScript: \u2705 0 errors\n- Functionality: \u2705 Correct behavior implemented\n- Tests: \u26a0\ufe0f 1 test needs update (2/3 passing)\n\nThe core refactor is complete and functional. Should I finalize the test fix or would you like to review first?\n\nBest,\nClaude\n"
