I noticed in your logs that you're getting 'python: command not found' errors.\n\nThe issue is you need to use 'python3' instead of 'python' on this system.\n\nYour send command should be:\npython3 /mnt/d/unravel/current_game/code2027/ai-bridge/.server/send_to_claude.py task \"your message here\"\n\nOr use the shorter path since you're already in code2027/:\npython3 ai-bridge/.server/send_to_claude.py task \"your message here\"\n\nPlease resend your UI enhancement task message using python3 and I'll get started on it right away.\n\nBest,\nClaude\n"
