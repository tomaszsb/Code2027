## [Unreleased]

### Refactoring (October 21, 2025)
- **Console Log Cleanup:**
  - Removed 51 verbose debugging console logs (18% reduction) from key files:
    - `NextStepButton.tsx`: 25 → 1 log (96% reduction)
    - `StateService.ts`: 46 → 40 logs (13% reduction)
    - `TurnService.ts`: 168 → 154 logs (8% reduction)
    - `TurnControls.tsx` (LEGACY): 51 → 44 logs (14% reduction)
  - Removed verbose function entry/exit logs, duplicate state notifications, and object dumps
  - Kept all `console.error()` and `console.warn()` statements for error handling
  - Kept strategic movement and card operation logs for ongoing development work
  - All 256 tests passing after cleanup (no functionality broken)

### Bug Fixes (October 21, 2025)
- **Test Suite Stabilization:**
  - Fixed ~105 failing tests across `TurnService`, `TimeSection`, `CardsSection`, `FinancesSection`, and `NextStepButton`.
  - Refactored `CardDetailsModal` and `DiscardedCardsModal` to use props-based Dependency Injection (DI).
  - Rewrote 4 `NextStepButton` tests (loading state) using a simplified approach.
- **`CHEAT-BYPASS` Space Bug Fix:**
  - Resolved an issue where the "Roll to Move" button on `CHEAT-BYPASS` did not lead to movement, and the `ChoiceModal` presented incorrect options.
  - Implemented a multi-phase fix addressing missing `dice_outcome` handling, `MovementService.validateMove()` issues, and multiple sources of incorrect `ChoiceModal` generation.
  - The `CHEAT-BYPASS` space now correctly presents a single, dice-determined destination via a `ChoiceModal`, allows the player to select it, and successfully moves the player with appropriate notifications.

### Features
- **Player Panel UI Refactor (October 12, 2025):**
  - Replaced the static player panel with a dynamic, component-based system using individual section components (e.g., `FinancesSection`, `TimeSection`, `CardsSection`).
  - Implemented a three-column header layout (Title, Actions, Summary) for all panel sections to improve information density and usability on all screen sizes.
  - Action buttons are now centered in the header and always visible.
  - Section summary text is now right-aligned for better readability.
  - Implemented an "exclusive accordion" for the Cards section, where opening one card type collapses others.
  - Iteratively refined UI spacing and button padding based on user feedback for a tighter, more compact design.

### Features (October 13, 2025)
- **Journey Timeline Enhancement:**
  - Added detailed visit tracking with days spent per space
  - Implemented `SpaceVisitRecord` interface to track entry/exit times and duration
  - Updated `TimeSection` to display days spent badges (e.g., "5d") for previously visited spaces
  - `MovementService` now automatically calculates and records time spent when leaving spaces
  - Backward compatible with existing saved games using the legacy `visitedSpaces` array

- **E Card Usability Features:**
  - Added visual phase restriction indicators for E cards based on current space phase
  - Implemented "Play Card" button for E cards that are currently playable
  - Added phase validation badges (green ✓ for playable, red ✗ for restricted cards)
  - Added helpful restriction messages explaining when cards can be used
  - Checks card `phase_restriction` field against current space's phase from GameConfig
  - Supports phase types: DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION, FUNDING, REGULATORY, or "Any"

### Bug Fixes
- **Critical `End Turn` Bug (October 12, 2025):**
  - Fixed a game-breaking bug in the `NextStepButton` component where it was calling the wrong service method (`turnService.endTurn()` instead of `turnService.endTurnWithMovement()`), preventing the game from advancing to the next player.

- **Card Money Sources Bug (October 13, 2025):**
  - Fixed bug in `CardService` where B (Bank) and I (Investment) cards were not adding money when played
  - Root cause: Code was checking for non-existent `loan_amount` and `investment_amount` CSV fields
  - Solution: Updated to use the correct `cost` field from Cards.csv with proper type checking
  - Money now correctly flows through `ResourceService` and appears in `moneySources.bankLoans` or `moneySources.investmentDeals`

- **Get Funding Button Handler (October 13, 2025):**
  - Fixed "Get Funding" button at `OWNER-FUND-INITIATION` space not triggering funding
  - Root cause: Button was calling `onRollDice` handler instead of dedicated funding handler
  - Solution: Added `onAutomaticFunding` prop chain from GameLayout → PlayerPanel → FinancesSection
  - Button now correctly calls `TurnService.handleAutomaticFunding()` to draw and apply funding cards

- **Movement Choice Premature Turn End Bug (October 16, 2025):**
  - Fixed bug where players could end their turn on decision spaces (like PM-DECISION-CHECK) before completing all required actions
  - Root cause 1: Movement intent wasn't being set when player selected a destination, so `moveIntent` was null at turn end
  - Root cause 2: `TurnControlsWithActions.tsx` had logic that incorrectly allowed ending turn immediately after selecting a movement destination
  - Solution 1: Added `setPlayerMoveIntent()` calls in `TurnService.handleMovementChoices()` and `restoreMovementChoiceIfNeeded()`
  - Solution 2: Removed the `movementChoice && selectedDestination !== null` bypass from `hasCompletedPrimaryAction` logic
  - Players now must complete all required actions (dice roll + manual effects) before ending turn on decision spaces

### Features (October 18, 2025)
- **Card Feedback Modal Enhancements:**
  - DiceResultModal now displays the actual names of cards drawn/removed/replaced (e.g., "Market Research", "New plumbing systems")
  - Card names appear below effect summaries in italics for better readability
  - Extended modal coverage to ALL card operations:
    - Dice rolls with card effects (already working, now enhanced with names)
    - Automatic funding at OWNER-FUND-INITIATION (now shows modal)
    - Manual card draws (Draw E cards, Draw W cards, etc. now show modals)
  - Added `data.cardIds` field to `EffectResult` for passing card IDs from Effect Engine
  - Added `cardIds` field to `DiceResultEffect` for modal display
  - Implemented callback chain: CardsSection → PlayerPanel → GameLayout for manual effect modals
  - Clear visual distinction: draw (+), remove (-), replace (↔) symbols

### Refactoring (October 16, 2025)
- **Data-Driven Space Configuration:**
  - Added `special_action` field to `SpaceContent` interface for future special space behaviors
  - Updated `DataService.parseSpaceContentCsv()` to parse `special_action` from SPACE_CONTENT.csv column 8
  - Removed hardcoded `OWNER-FUND-INITIATION` checks in `TurnControlsWithActions.tsx`:
    - `canRollDice` now uses `requiresManualDiceRoll` from GAME_CONFIG.csv instead of hardcoded space name
    - `hasCompletedPrimaryAction` now uses `!requiresManualDiceRoll` instead of checking space name
  - All space-specific behaviors now driven by CSV configuration rather than hardcoded logic
  - Improves maintainability and makes it easier to add new special spaces without code changes
