## PROJECT AUDIT AND RE-ALIGNMENT - August 17, 2025

**NOTE:** This audit superseded all previous status reports and led to a re-prioritization of development efforts.

### 1. Audit Summary

A joint analysis by Gemini and Claude found that while the project had a strong architectural foundation, there were critical deviations from the roadmap in the implementation. The project status was not "COMPLETE" as previously indicated.

### 2. Key Priorities Identified

1.  **Restore Architectural Integrity:**
    *   Refactor `CardService`: Remove hardcoded data and use `DataService`.
    *   Extract Logic from Components: Move business logic from UI components into services.
    *   Implement `PlayerActionService`: Build the missing service.

2.  **Fulfill Roadmap Requirements:**
    *   Implement Testing: Add unit tests for all services and component tests for the UI.
    *   Decompose Oversized Components: Break down the 6+ components that violate the 200-line limit.

3.  **Code Quality Refinement:**
    *   Extract Inline Styles: Convert large inline style objects in components to CSS Modules or a similar solution.

## CSV Data Structure Restructure Plan (Historical Context)

This plan outlined the strategy to transform messy, multi-concern CSV files into a clean, single-purpose architecture.

### Original Problem Analysis:
*   `Spaces.csv` (22 mixed columns): Movement logic mixed with effects, story text mixed with game rules, complex parsing, hard to maintain.
*   `DiceRoll Info.csv`: Mixed data types, hard to parse different effect types, inconsistent data format.

### Proposed Clean Structure (Implemented in `data/CLEAN_FILES/`):
1.  **`MOVEMENT.csv`**: Pure space-to-space connections.
2.  **`DICE_OUTCOMES.csv`**: What happens when you roll dice.
3.  **`SPACE_EFFECTS.csv`**: All card, time, and money effects.
4.  **`DICE_EFFECTS.csv`**: Effects that happen based on dice rolls.
5.  **`SPACE_CONTENT.csv`**: All display text and story content.
6.  **`GAME_CONFIG.csv`**: Game configuration and phase information.

### Implementation Strategy (Historical):
*   **Phase 1: Create New CSV Files:** Extraction of data into the new clean CSVs.
*   **Phase 2: Update Code Architecture:** Creation of specialized engines (now services) for Movement, Effects, Content, and Dice.
*   **Phase 3: Benefits Achieved:** Easier coding, better debugging, faster development, cleaner architecture, easier maintenance, better testing.

---

## Step-by-Step Migration Plan (Historical Context)

This plan guided the replacement of messy CSV parsing with the new clean CSV architecture, using a parallel implementation strategy to minimize risk.

### Key Phases:
*   **Phase 1: Setup New Data Loading:** Adding new files and testing data loading.
*   **Phase 2: Parallel Content Display:** Identifying current content code and creating comparison functions.
*   **Phase 3: Parallel Movement Logic:** Testing movement calculations and dice roll logic.
*   **Phase 4: Parallel Effects System:** Testing effects calculation.
*   **Phase 5: Gradual Cutover:** Switching content, movement, and effects logic to the new system.
*   **Phase 6: Complete Transition:** Removing old CSV files and cleaning up code.
*   **Phase 7: Optimization & Enhancement:** Adding error handling, data caching, and enhanced features.

## RECENT SESSION WORK - August 23, 2025

### âœ… **Critical Production Bug Resolution: Starting Position Fix**
**Session Date:** August 23, 2025  
**Status:** COMPLETED - HIGH PRIORITY BUG RESOLVED  
**Issue:** Players were starting on wrong space, affecting core game flow.
**Root Cause:** Application loading CSV data from `/public/data/CLEAN_FILES/` instead of `/data/CLEAN_FILES/`, leading to duplicate and incorrect `GAME_CONFIG.csv` usage.
**Solution:** Updated `public/data/CLEAN_FILES/GAME_CONFIG.csv` to correct starting space.

### âœ… **UI Enhancement: Tutorial Space Removal from Game Board**
**Session Date:** August 23, 2025  
**Status:** COMPLETED - UX IMPROVEMENT  
**Issue:** `START-QUICK-PLAY-GUIDE` was displaying on game board despite being tutorial-only.
**Solution:** Modified `src/components/game/GameBoard.tsx` to filter out tutorial spaces based on `path_type` from `GAME_CONFIG.csv`.
