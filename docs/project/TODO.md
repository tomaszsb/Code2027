## âœ… **PHASE COMPLETION: Player Panel UI Overhaul**
*Status: COMPLETED - October 7, 2025*

**Objective**: Resolve critical UI instability in the Player Panel, which caused distracting resizing and layout shifts during gameplay.

- **âœ… Root Cause Analysis**: Diagnosed the issue as dynamic styling and layout properties changing on user interaction.
- **âœ… Robust Implementation**: Implemented a professional, responsive `ResponsiveSheet` component that functions as a modal on desktop and a native-style bottom sheet on mobile.
- **âœ… UI Standardization**: Migrated all pop-up panels (Financials, Card Portfolio, Space Explorer, etc.) to use the new, consistent `ResponsiveSheet` component.
- **âœ… Bug Fixes**: In the process, Claude identified and fixed several related bugs, including a critical issue with the "Try Again" turn logic.

**Result**: A stable, professional, and consistent UI for all player panel interactions, improving the user experience and preparing the application for a mobile-first future.

## âœ… **PHASE COMPLETION: Game Log Polish & Bug Fixes**
*Status: COMPLETED - October 4, 2025*

**Objective**: Resolve critical data and rendering bugs in the Game Log and implement UI/UX enhancements based on Owner feedback.

- **âœ… Bug Fixes**: Resolved a long-standing, complex series of bugs causing the Game Log to display incorrect data ("Unknown Space", incorrect turn numbers). The root causes were a combination of stale server cache, incorrect data properties, and flawed frontend rendering logic.
- **âœ… UI Feature**: Implemented a new feature to hide the Game Log by default.
- **âœ… UI Feature**: Added a "Toggle Log" button inside the Project Progress panel to control Game Log visibility.
- **âœ… UI Polish**: Added a `(1)`/`(S)` indicator to log entries to show "First" or "Subsequent" visits.
- **âœ… Bug Fix**: Corrected a filter to properly hide redundant "entered space" messages from the log's action list.

---

## âœ… **PHASE COMPLETION: Communication System Enhancements**
*Status: COMPLETED - September 30, 2025*

**Objective**: Improve the AI-to-AI communication protocol and user oversight tools to streamline collaboration.

- **âœ… Task 1: Automatic Mailbox Checking** - Implemented automatic message checking for both AIs at the start of each turn.
- **âœ… Task 2: Pending Message Flag** - Implemented an explicit 'pending' flag in message metadata for the bridge UI.
- **âœ… Task 3: Approve/Reject Endpoints** - Created backend API routes for the new bridge UI buttons.
- **âœ… Task 4: Deploy Bridge UI** - Restarted the bridge server to deploy the new web interface.

## âœ… **PHASE COMPLETION: Turn Numbering System Fix**
*Status: COMPLETED - October 3, 2025*

**Objective**: Fix the confusing and incorrect turn numbering system in the game log to properly distinguish between game rounds, player turns, and individual actions.

**Problem Statement**: Current game log shows inconsistent turn numbers, system logs cluttering player view, and no clear distinction between game rounds vs individual player actions.

- **[âœ…] Backend**: `StateService.ts` and `TurnService.ts` updated to remove deprecated `turn` property and use `globalTurnCount`.
- **[âœ…] Frontend**: `GameLog.tsx` updated to group player turns into collapsible rounds.
- **[âœ…] Verification**: Final fix applied to TurnService.ts:421 (notification system now uses `globalTurnCount`).
- **[âœ…] Testing**: All TurnService tests (23/23) and E2E tests passing.

**Result**: Turn numbering system fully migrated to new `globalTurnCount` system. All deprecated `turn` property usages eliminated from active code paths.

## âœ… **PHASE COMPLETION: Per_200K Calculation Fix & Snapshot Timing Fix**
*Status: COMPLETED - October 3, 2025*

**Objective**: Fix per_200K calculation bug affecting BANK-FUND-REVIEW space effects and resolve snapshot timing issue preventing first-visit effects from processing.

### **Per_200K Calculation Bug Fix**
**Problem**: BANK-FUND-REVIEW space effect "1 day per $200K borrowed" was adding fixed value (1 time) instead of scaling by loan amount.

- **[âœ…] Root Cause Identified**: TurnService.ts:1198 and 1231 used base `value` instead of calculating scaled amount based on loan principals
- **[âœ…] Fix Implemented**: Added proper per_200K calculation:
  ```typescript
  const totalBorrowed = player.loans?.reduce((sum, loan) => sum + loan.principal, 0) || 0;
  const multiplier = Math.floor(totalBorrowed / 200000);
  additionalTime = value * multiplier;
  ```
- **[âœ…] Location**: TurnService.ts:1199-1247 (money effects) and 1242-1254 (time effects)

### **Snapshot Timing Bug Fix**
**Problem**: Snapshots were saved BEFORE processing space effects, causing `processSpaceEffectsAfterMovement()` to skip effects on first visit.

- **[âœ…] Root Cause Identified**: TurnService.startTurn() line 494 saved snapshot, then line 504 processed effects which found snapshot and skipped
- **[âœ…] Fix Implemented**: Moved `savePreSpaceEffectSnapshot()` call to AFTER `processSpaceEffectsAfterMovement()`
- **[âœ…] Location**: TurnService.ts:502-505
- **[âœ…] Verification**: E2E-01_HappyPath.test.ts still passes (no regression)

### **Key Learning**
Time effects process when LEAVING a space (via `processLeavingSpaceEffects()`), not when arriving. This represents time spent at the location.

**Result**: Both bugs fixed and verified. Space effects now process correctly on first visit AND scale properly based on loan amounts.

## âœ… **PHASE COMPLETION: Game Log & Turn Sequence Overhaul**
*Status: COMPLETED September 25, 2025*

A full-stack refactor of the game logging system and core turn logic.
- **UI Overhaul**: âœ… Implemented a new data-driven Game Log UI with collapsible, color-coded, and correctly sequenced entries.
- **Core Logic Fix**: âœ… Refactored `TurnService` to unify the turn-start sequence, fixing race conditions and ensuring arrival effects process before player actions.
- **Logging Architecture**: âœ… Centralized logging responsibility and removed dozens of redundant, low-level log entries.
- **First-Turn Fix**: âœ… The `startGame` function now correctly separates player placement from effects processing, ensuring the first turn's logging is consistent with all subsequent turns.

## âœ… **PHASE COMPLETION: Robust Transactional Logging**
*Status: COMPLETED September 28, 2025*

**Objective**: Refactor the logging system to be transactional, ensuring the game log is a 100% accurate record of all committed actions, especially when handling the "Try Again" mechanic.

- âœ… **Architecture**: Implemented the "Dual-Layer Logging" architecture with `isCommitted` and `explorationSessionId` fields.
- âœ… **Services**: Updated `LoggingService` with session lifecycle management (`startNewExplorationSession`, `commitCurrentSession`, `cleanupAbandonedSessions`).
- âœ… **TurnService Integration**: Integrated session management into `startTurn()`, `endTurn()`, and `tryAgainOnSpace()` methods.
- âœ… **Types**: Added transactional logging fields to `ActionLogEntry` and `GameState` types.
- âœ… **Testing**: Implemented comprehensive test suite (`TransactionalLogging.test.ts`) with 11 tests covering all edge cases.
- âœ… **Documentation**: Updated `TECHNICAL_DEEP_DIVE.md` and `testing-guide.md` with complete architecture documentation.

**Result**: Game log now maintains 100% accuracy with abandoned "Try Again" sessions preserved for analysis but excluded from canonical history.
