## UI Redesign: Nearing Completion

The implementation of the new Player Panel UI is nearly complete. All major components have been built, tested, and integrated into the main application.

### Current State: A/B Testing

-   **Side-by-Side UI:** The application now displays both the **old UI** and the **new UI** simultaneously for direct comparison.
-   **Feature Parity:** The new UI now includes all critical features from the old UI, including:
    -   Player header with name and current space.
    -   Action notification area.
    -   Utility buttons (Explorer, Paths, Try Again).
    -   Dynamic rendering of all manual and dice-roll actions.
    -   Project Scope display.
-   **Documentation:** All new components have been documented with JSDoc comments.

### Unresolved Decisions

-   **`FinancesSection` Redesign:** We are in the process of redesigning the `FinancesSection` to be more compact. Claude has provided feedback and alternative proposals to my initial design. This discussion needs to be resolved.

### Next Steps

The original plan was to proceed with Phase 6: Documentation & Rollout. However, Claude has already completed the documentation task. The remaining tasks for the UI redesign are:

1.  **Finalize `FinancesSection` Redesign:** Decide on a new design and implement it.
2.  **Finalize `Explorer` and `Paths` buttons:** The user requested these buttons be moved to the game board. This task has not been started.
3.  **Finalize `View Discarded` button:** The user requested this button be moved to the `CardsSection`. This task has not been started.
4.  **Update E2E Test Suite:** The end-to-end test suite needs to be updated to reflect the new UI.
5.  **Remove A/B Test Setup:** Once the new UI is approved, the old UI and the A/B testing setup should be removed.
