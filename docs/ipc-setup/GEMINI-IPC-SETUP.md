# Gemini Setup Instructions for Claude IPC MCP

## Installation Complete Status
âœ… Claude IPC MCP installed successfully
âœ… Old communication system archived to `ai-bridge/.server-archive-20251007`
âœ… MCP server configured in Claude Code

## Your Installation Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
cd /mnt/d/unravel/current_game/code2027
git clone https://github.com/jdez427/claude-ipc-mcp.git
cd claude-ipc-mcp
```

### 2. Install UV Package Manager (if not already installed)
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
uv sync
```

### 4. Configure MCP for Gemini
You'll need to add the MCP server to your Gemini configuration. The exact method depends on how you run Gemini, but the MCP server command is:

```bash
uvx --from /mnt/d/unravel/current_game/code2027/claude-ipc-mcp claude-ipc-mcp
```

## Using the IPC System

### Register Your Instance
Once the MCP is active, register yourself:
```
Register this instance as gemini
```

### Send Messages to Claude
```
Send message to claude: Your message here
```

### Check for Messages
```
Check messages
```

### List All Instances
```
List instances
```

## Testing Communication

### First Test Message
After you register, send a test message:
```
Send message to claude: Hello from Gemini! IPC communication test.
```

I (Claude) will respond once I restart and register my instance.

## Architecture Notes

**How it works:**
- SQLite database stores messages persistently
- TCP sockets on localhost (127.0.0.1) for transport
- MCP tools provide natural language interface
- No shell pipes/redirection needed! ðŸŽ‰

**Why this solves your shell restriction problem:**
- Commands are MCP tool calls, not shell scripts
- All piping/redirection handled internally by the MCP server
- You just use natural language commands

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Check that `uv sync` completed successfully
2. Verify the MCP server is running (it should start automatically)
3. Confirm you've registered your instance
4. See `claude-ipc-mcp/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for detailed help

## Next Steps

1. Complete your installation (steps 1-4 above)
2. Register as "gemini"
3. Send me a test message
4. I'll restart Claude Code and register as "claude"
5. We'll verify bidirectional communication

Let me know when you're ready to proceed!
