# DEVELOPMENT.md - Code2027 Project Progress

**Project Management Board Game - Modern Architecture Implementation**

## Project Overview

Code2027 represents a complete architectural overhaul of the legacy code2026 board game implementation. The project focuses on building a clean, maintainable, and testable codebase using modern development practices and TypeScript service architecture.

## Phase 1: Service Layer Foundation âœ… COMPLETED

**Duration**: November - December 2024  
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED with >90% test coverage

### Key Achievements

**Core Services Implemented**:
- **DataService**: Centralized CSV data access with caching and validation
- **StateService**: Immutable game state management with event subscriptions  
- **TurnService**: Complete turn orchestration and dice-based effects
- **CardService**: Complex card ecosystem with 60+ test scenarios
- **MovementService**: Stateless movement logic for all movement types
- **GameRulesService**: Centralized validation authority

**Architecture Benefits**:
- **Dependency Injection**: Clean separation of concerns with testable dependencies
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage eliminating runtime errors
- **Immutable Patterns**: State changes through pure functions preventing bugs
- **Service Orchestration**: Services collaborate without tight coupling
- **Comprehensive Testing**: >90% coverage across all services

**Technical Metrics**:
- 6 core services with 300+ test cases
- Zero `window.*` calls (eliminated Service Locator anti-pattern)
- 94%+ test coverage on all services
- Full TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Efficient service instantiation and dependency injection

## Phase 2: Component Refactoring âœ… SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS

**Duration**: December 2024  
**Status**: âœ… Core UI Components Completed

### Major Accomplishments

**Component Architecture**:
- **Service Integration**: React Context provider for clean dependency injection
- **PlayerSetup**: Complete player management with validation and conflict resolution
- **CardModal**: Fully functional modal system integrated with services
- **GameLayout**: Modern grid-based layout replacing legacy FixedApp structure

**UI Innovation - "Player Handheld" Design**:
- **PlayerStatusPanel**: Container managing all player status displays
- **PlayerStatusItem**: Individual player cards with integrated actions
- **Jackbox Model**: Transitioned to individual player interfaces vs global dashboards
- **Horizontal Layout**: Phone landscape 16:9 rectangles for optimal tablet/mobile UX

**Technical Implementation**:
- Real-time StateService subscriptions for live updates
- Conditional actions rendering only for current player
- Responsive design with proper spacing and visual hierarchy
- Component isolation enabling independent testing and development

## Phase 3: Advanced UI Components (IN PROGRESS)

**Current Focus**: Building remaining game board and interaction components

### Completed Components
- âœ… **Player Status System**: Complete with actions integration
- âœ… **Card Modal System**: Fully functional with service connections
- âœ… **Player Setup Flow**: Multi-player game initialization
- âœ… **Layout Foundation**: Grid-based responsive game interface

### Next Priority Components
- ðŸ”„ **Game Board Display**: Central board visualization
- ðŸ”„ **Turn Controls Panel**: Bottom panel for game flow management
- ðŸ”„ **Card Hand Display**: Player's card collection interface
- ðŸ”„ **Space Interaction Modal**: Space-specific action handling

## Architecture Evolution

### Legacy Problems Solved âœ…
- **Service Locator Anti-pattern**: Eliminated 312 `window.*` calls
- **God Objects**: Replaced 30K+ token GameStateManager with focused services
- **Mixed Responsibilities**: Separated UI, business logic, and state management
- **Event Spaghetti**: Clean subscription patterns replace 106 random events
- **React Anti-patterns**: JSX throughout, eliminated 940 `React.createElement` calls

### Modern Patterns Implemented âœ…
- **Service-Oriented Architecture**: Single responsibility services with clear interfaces
- **Dependency Injection**: Constructor injection with React Context integration
- **Immutable State Management**: Pure functions for all state transitions
- **TypeScript First**: Strict typing eliminating runtime errors
- **Test-Driven Development**: >90% coverage with meaningful test scenarios

---

## Strategic Design Decisions

### "Jackbox Model" UI Philosophy
**Vision**: Individual player interfaces vs traditional dashboard approach
- **Player Focus**: Each player has their own personalized card with integrated actions
- **Turn Clarity**: Visual and functional focus shifts automatically to current player
- **Mobile Optimization**: Horizontal layouts optimized for tablet/phone gameplay
- **Scalability**: Foundation for future features like personal card hands and scoring

### Service Architecture Benefits
**Maintainability**: Each service has focused, well-defined responsibilities
**Testability**: Isolated services with mocked dependencies enable comprehensive testing  
**Performance**: Efficient subscription patterns and optimized state management
**Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage prevents entire classes of runtime bugs
