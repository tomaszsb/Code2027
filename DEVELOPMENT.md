- Proper state management preventing race conditions

**Multi-Action Turn Structure (Major Refactor)**:
- Fundamental game flow change from automatic to manual turn ending
- New `hasPlayerMovedThisTurn` state tracking
- Separate `takeTurn()` and `endTurn()` methods in TurnService
- Roll Dice button disabled after use, End Turn button enabled after movement
- Infrastructure ready for future multi-action gameplay (card play, etc.)

### Technical Achievements
- âœ… **Robust State Management**: Enhanced GameState with turn tracking
- âœ… **Button Logic**: Intelligent enabling/disabling based on turn state
- âœ… **AI Integration**: Seamless AI automation adapted to new turn structure
- âœ… **Bug Fixes**: Eliminated stale state issues in test functionality

## Architecture Evolution

### Legacy Problems Solved âœ…
- **Service Locator Anti-pattern**: Eliminated 312 `window.*` calls
- **God Objects**: Replaced 30K+ token GameStateManager with focused services
- **Mixed Responsibilities**: Separated UI, business logic, and state management
- **Event Spaghetti**: Clean subscription patterns replace 106 random events
- **React Anti-patterns**: JSX throughout, eliminated 940 `React.createElement` calls

### Modern Patterns Implemented âœ…
- **Service-Oriented Architecture**: Single responsibility services with clear interfaces
- **Dependency Injection**: Constructor injection with React Context integration
- **Immutable State Management**: Pure functions for all state transitions
- **TypeScript First**: Strict typing eliminating runtime errors
- **Test-Driven Development**: >90% coverage with meaningful test scenarios

---

## Strategic Design Decisions

### "Jackbox Model" UI Philosophy
**Vision**: Individual player interfaces vs traditional dashboard approach
- **Player Focus**: Each player has their own personalized card with integrated actions
- **Turn Clarity**: Visual and functional focus shifts automatically to current player
- **Mobile Optimization**: Horizontal layouts optimized for tablet/phone gameplay
- **Scalability**: Foundation for future features like personal card hands and scoring

### Service Architecture Benefits
**Maintainability**: Each service has focused, well-defined responsibilities
**Testability**: Isolated services with mocked dependencies enable comprehensive testing  
**Performance**: Efficient subscription patterns and optimized state management
**Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage prevents entire classes of runtime bugs
