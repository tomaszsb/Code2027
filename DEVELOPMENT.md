# Project Status Audit & Action Plan - August 17, 2025

## 1. Executive Summary

A detailed audit of the `code2027` codebase was performed by both Gemini and Claude. The analysis revealed that while the foundational service-layer architecture is excellent and adheres to the principles in the `REFACTORING_ROADMAP.md`, the component layer has significant architectural violations and the project deviates from its goals in key areas like testing and code standards.

This document replaces the previous status report to provide an accurate, up-to-date assessment of the project and a clear, prioritized action plan.

**Overall Assessment:**
*   **Service & Data Architecture:** **B-** (Excellent foundation, but undermined by a critical data integrity flaw in the `CardService`).
*   **Component Architecture:** **D** (Significant violations in component size, separation of concerns, and a complete lack of testing).

---

## 2. Detailed Findings

### Architectural Strengths
*   **Service-Oriented Architecture:** The core services (`StateService`, `TurnService`, etc.) are well-designed and implemented.
*   **Dependency Injection:** The `ServiceProvider` correctly implements DI, eliminating the old Service Locator anti-pattern.
*   **TypeScript & State Management:** The project makes excellent use of TypeScript's strict mode and immutable state patterns.

### Critical Gaps & Violations
*   **Architectural Flaw in `CardService`:** The service contains hardcoded data for card effects (e.g., `moneyGain = 50`), which violates the fundamental "CSV-as-Database" principle.
*   **Component Architecture Violations:**
    *   **Mixed Responsibilities:** Components like `PlayerSetup.tsx` and `TurnControls.tsx` contain business logic that belongs in services.
    *   **File Size Limits:** 6 components exceed the 200-line limit defined in the roadmap.
    *   **Missing Service:** The `PlayerActionService` is a placeholder and has not been implemented.
*   **Lack of Testing:** Component test coverage is currently at 0%, falling far short of the 80%+ roadmap goal.

## 3. Prioritized Action Plan

This is the agreed-upon order of operations to bring the project back into alignment with its architectural goals.

### Priority 1: Restore Core Architectural Integrity
*These issues violate the fundamental rules of the new architecture and must be fixed first.*

1.  **Refactor `CardService` to be Data-Driven:** Modify the service to fetch all card effect values from the `DataService`.
2.  **Extract Business Logic from Components:** Move validation and other business logic from `PlayerSetup.tsx` and `TurnControls.tsx` into the appropriate services.
3.  **Implement `PlayerActionService`:** Create the full implementation for the missing service to complete the dependency injection contract.

### Priority 2: Fulfill Roadmap Requirements
*These items represent significant gaps against the project's documented goals.*

1.  **Implement a Testing Strategy:**
    *   **Unit Tests:** Begin by writing unit tests for the foundational services (`DataService`, `StateService`).
    *   **Component Tests:** Follow up with component tests using React Testing Library.
2.  **Decompose Oversized Components:** Break down the 6 components that violate the 200-line limit into smaller, single-responsibility components.

### Priority 3: Code Quality Refinement
*These items will improve maintainability and should be addressed after the critical issues above.*

1.  **Extract Inline Styles:** Refactor components like `PlayerStatusItem.tsx` to use CSS Modules or a similar solution instead of massive inline style objects.

### Architectural Patterns Established 🏗️

The recent work has successfully established key architectural patterns that resolve the critical gaps identified in the audit:

#### **1. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) - PROVEN**
```typescript
// Clean service orchestration established
PlayerActionService → DataService + StateService + GameRulesService
```
- **Single Responsibility:** Each service has a focused, well-defined role
- **Dependency Injection:** All services receive dependencies via constructor
- **Interface Contracts:** Proper TypeScript interfaces define service boundaries
- **Testability:** Services can be tested in isolation with mocked dependencies

#### **2. UI-to-Service Communication Pattern - ESTABLISHED**
```typescript
// Pattern now established for all future UI components
const { playerActionService, stateService } = useGameContext();

const handleAction = async () => {
  try {
    await playerActionService.someAction(params);
    // Handle success
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle error with user feedback
  }
};
```
- **Hook-Based Access:** useGameContext() provides clean service access
- **Async Error Handling:** Consistent try-catch with user feedback
- **State Integration:** Automatic UI updates through service state changes
- **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript coverage from UI to services

#### **3. Data-Driven Architecture - IMPLEMENTED**
```typescript
// CSV data properly integrated throughout stack
DataService.loadCards() → Card[] → PlayerActionService.playCard() → UI Updates
```
- **Single Source of Truth:** All card data comes from CSV files
- **Validation Pipeline:** Data validated at load time and usage time
- **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript types from CSV to UI
- **Error Resilience:** Comprehensive error handling at each layer

#### **4. Testing Strategy - PROVEN**
```typescript
// Comprehensive testing patterns established
- Service Unit Tests: Mock dependencies, test business logic
- Integration Tests: Verify service interactions
- Component Tests: Mock useGameContext, test UI integration
```
- **Mock-Based Testing:** Clean isolation with jest mocks
- **Error Scenario Coverage:** Test both success and failure paths
- **Service Contract Testing:** Verify interface compliance
- **Integration Validation:** Test service interaction patterns

### Critical Gaps Resolved ✅

- **After:** Complete end-to-end flow from button click to state update
- **Impact:** Establishes pattern for all future UI functionality

#### **✅ Data Integration**
- **Before:** Mock data in services with no CSV integration
- **After:** Real CSV data loaded and used throughout application
- **Impact:** Game uses actual card data with proper effects and validation
