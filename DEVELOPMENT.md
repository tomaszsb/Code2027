## ðŸš€ **WORK IN PROGRESS: Robust Transactional Logging - September 28, 2025**

**Objective**: To refactor the game's logging system to be fully transactional, ensuring the final post-game log is a 100% accurate record of all committed player actions. This initiative will correct a flaw where the "Try Again" mechanic would leave aborted actions in the log, making it unreliable for student and teacher analysis. The new architecture will use a dual-layer logging system to logically separate committed and exploratory actions.

## ðŸŽ® **GAME LOG AND TURN SEQUENCE OVERHAUL - September 25, 2025**

### âœ… **Phase Completion: Game Log UI/UX and Core Logic Refactor**
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Summary**: A deep, iterative refactoring of the entire game logging system and underlying turn sequence logic. This addressed critical bugs related to display, ordering, and gameplay sequence, resulting in a stable and intuitive game log.

### **Issues Addressed**
1.  **Incorrect Colors & Grouping**: Log entries were not using correct player colors and were not grouped by turn, making the log difficult to read.
2.  **Out-of-Sequence Events**: Critical gameplay logic was executing in the wrong order (e.g., arrival effects happening after player actions), causing confusion.
3.  **Duplicate & Missing Logs**: The log was cluttered with repetitive entries for a single action, while some manual actions were not being logged at all.

### **Architectural Changes Implemented**

1.  **Smart Logging Service (`LoggingService.ts`)**:
    - The `determineActionType` function was refactored to be "intelligent." It no longer relies on callers providing a perfect `action` type.
    - It now infers the correct log type by inspecting the content of the log message itself, providing a robust, centralized solution to type categorization.

2.  **Unified Turn-Start Logic (`TurnService.ts`)**:
    - The separate, buggy code path for the game's first turn was eliminated.
    - A single, unified `startTurn(playerId)` function was created to handle the beginning of *all* turns (first and subsequent).
    - This function now enforces the correct sequence of operations: **1. Lock UI -> 2. Save Snapshot -> 3. Process Arrival Effects -> 4. Unlock UI**.

3.  **Centralized Logging (`NotificationService.ts`, `CardService.ts`)**:
    - Redundant, low-level logging calls were removed from multiple services.
    - The system now follows a clearer pattern where higher-level services are responsible for initiating logs, resulting in a cleaner, de-duplicated log.

4.  **Data-Driven UI (`GameLog.tsx`)**:
    - The UI component was refactored to be purely data-driven.
    - It now correctly renders collapsible, color-coded, and properly ordered log groups based on the `type` of the log entries it receives.

### **Post-Refactor Fixes (September 27, 2025)**
- **First-Turn Unification**: The `startGame` logic was updated to use `placePlayersOnStartingSpaces`, which separates player placement from effect processing. This resolves the long-standing issue where the first turn's events were logged out of sequence. All turns now follow the same unified and correct lifecycle.
- **Log Sequencing**: Corrected the processing order to ensure player logs appear in the correct sequence and that the "entered space" log is always the first entry.
- **"Try Again" Logic**: Fixed a bug in the "Try Again" feature to ensure turn progression now correctly moves to the next player after the time penalty is applied.
