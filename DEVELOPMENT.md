## üéØ Project Overview

The code2027 project represents a complete architectural refactor of the critically broken code2026 prototype. The primary objective was to eliminate severe technical debt while implementing modern software architecture patterns, transforming a prototype with Service Locator anti-patterns, God Objects, and event spaghetti into a robust, maintainable application.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Key Architectural Achievements

### ‚úÖ **1. Robust Service-Oriented Architecture Implementation**

Successfully implemented a clean, dependency-injected service architecture that completely eliminates the architectural anti-patterns of code2026:

```typescript
// Before (code2026): Service Locator anti-pattern
const gsm = window.GameStateManager; // 312 instances of this pattern

// After (code2027): Clean dependency injection
constructor(
  private dataService: DataService,
  private stateService: StateService,
  private resourceService: ResourceService
) {}
```

**Services Implemented**:
- **DataService**: Single source of truth for all CSV data access
- **StateService**: Immutable game state management
- **TurnService**: Turn progression and win condition handling
- **CardService**: Complete card lifecycle management
- **PlayerActionService**: Command pattern for all player actions
- **MovementService**: Movement logic and validation
- **GameRulesService**: Centralized business rule validation
- **EffectEngineService**: Unified game logic processing engine

### ‚úÖ **2. Creation of Unified Effect Engine**

The crown achievement of the refactor - a centralized system that standardizes all game event processing:

- **EffectFactory**: Converts raw CSV data into standardized Effect objects
- **8 Core Effect Types**: Discriminated union pattern for type-safe game actions
- **EffectEngineService**: Central processor orchestrating all game logic through specialized services

This eliminated code duplication, ensured consistent behavior, and created a single testable pipeline for all game mechanics.

### ‚úÖ **3. Complete Decoupling of Game Data from Game Logic**

Achieved complete separation between data storage (CSV files) and business logic:

- All data access flows through DataService
- EffectFactory translates data structures into executable effects
- Game logic operates on Effect objects, not raw CSV data
- Easy to change data formats without affecting game mechanics

### ‚úÖ **4. Successful Implementation of All Core Gameplay Mechanics**

All major game systems successfully implemented on the new architecture:

- **Multi-player gameplay** with proper turn progression
- **Complete card system** with 24 different card types and effects
- **Movement system** supporting choice, dice, and fixed movement
- **Win condition detection** and end game sequence
- **Real-time UI updates** through immutable state management

### ‚úÖ **5. Comprehensive E2E Testing Validation**

Created and executed a complete E2E testing suite that validated system stability:

- **E2E-01**: Happy path 2-player game flow validation
- **E2E-02**: Complex card mechanics with multi-player targeting
- **E2E-03**: Complex space entry with choice-based movement

### üõ†Ô∏è Critical Fixes - August 26, 2025 ‚úÖ

**Effect Condition Evaluation System**
**Status**: Complete implementation of data-driven effect condition evaluation

#### **Problem Solved**
- **Issue**: All CSV effect conditions (scope_le_4M, dice_roll_X, etc.) were logged but never evaluated
- **Impact**: Effects like "Draw B card if scope ‚â§ $4M" always applied regardless of actual scope
- **Root Cause**: Missing condition evaluation logic in effect processing

#### **Solution Implemented**
**File**: `src/services/TurnService.ts`

1. **Added `evaluateEffectCondition()` method**:
   ```typescript
   private evaluateEffectCondition(playerId: string, condition: string | undefined, diceRoll?: number): boolean
   ```

2. **Comprehensive condition support**:
   - `scope_le_4M` / `scope_gt_4M` - Project scope evaluation
   - `dice_roll_1` through `dice_roll_6` - Dice-specific conditions
   - `always` - Universal application
   - Loan amount, direction, and percentage conditions

3. **Project scope calculation**:
   ```typescript
   private calculateProjectScope(player: Player): number
   ```

4. **Integration points**:
   - Space effects: Condition checked before applying
   - Dice effects: Proper handling of roll_X structure
   - Manual effects: Condition validation before trigger

**Action Counting Logic Fix**
**Status**: Fixed phantom action counting issue

#### **Problem Solved**
- **Issue**: Players saw "4/4 actions completed" but only had 1-2 actual actions available
- **Impact**: Confusing UI showing phantom actions with no buttons
- **Root Cause**: Automatic effects counted as separate required actions

#### **Solution Implemented**
**File**: `src/services/StateService.ts`

1. **Removed automatic effects from required action count**:
   - Time, money, card effects with `trigger_type !== 'manual'` are now triggered by dice roll
   - Only manual effects and dice roll count as required actions

2. **Proper action calculation**:
   - PM-DECISION-CHECK: 2 actions (dice + manual replace)
   - OWNER-FUND-INITIATION: 1 action (dice only)
   - OWNER-SCOPE-INITIATION: 2 actions (dice + manual draw)

#### **Technical Details**
- **Before**: `Required=4, Types=[time_auto, cards_auto, cards_auto, dice_roll]`
- **After**: `Required=2, Types=[cards_manual, dice_roll]`

**Result**: Game now properly evaluates all CSV conditions and shows accurate action counts.

### üèóÔ∏è Project Scope System & Effect Architecture Enhancement - August 27, 2025 ‚úÖ

**Total Project Scope Implementation**
**Status**: Complete implementation of automatic Work card value tracking system

#### **System Overview**
Created comprehensive Project Scope tracking that automatically calculates and displays the total cost of a player's Work (W) cards in real-time. The system integrates seamlessly with the existing Effect Engine architecture.

#### **Key Implementation Details**

**1. Enhanced Player State** ‚úÖ
- **Files**: `src/types/DataTypes.ts`, `src/types/StateTypes.ts`
- **Added**: `projectScope: number` property to Player interface
- **Integration**: Automatic initialization to 0 for new players

**2. Scope Calculation Service** ‚úÖ
- **File**: `src/services/GameRulesService.ts` 
- **Method**: `calculateProjectScope(playerId: string): number`
- **Logic**: Iterates through W cards, sums `work_cost` or `cost` properties
- **Features**: Error handling, card validation, comprehensive logging

**3. UI Integration** ‚úÖ
- **File**: `src/components/game/PlayerStatusItem.tsx`
- **Display**: `üèóÔ∏è ${FormatUtils.formatMoney(player.projectScope || 0)}`
- **Position**: Integrated between Time and Card Portfolio sections
- **Updates**: Real-time updates through state management

**RECALCULATE_SCOPE Effect Architecture** 
**Status**: Critical bug fix implementing dedicated effect type for consistent scope updates

#### **Problem Solved**
Project Scope was not updating correctly due to processing order issues in the effect system. Direct scope calculation in CardService bypassed the unified effect processing, causing inconsistencies.

#### **Solution Architecture**

**1. New Effect Type** ‚úÖ
- **File**: `src/types/EffectTypes.ts`
- **Added**: `RECALCULATE_SCOPE` effect with `{ playerId: string }` payload
- **Added**: `isRecalculateScopeEffect()` type guard function

**2. EffectFactory Enhancement** ‚úÖ
- **File**: `src/utils/EffectFactory.ts`
- **Enhancement**: Automatically generates `RECALCULATE_SCOPE` effects alongside `CARD_DRAW` effects for W cards
- **Coverage**: Card effects, space effects, dice effects
- **Logic**: Any W card acquisition triggers scope recalculation

**3. CardService Refactoring** ‚úÖ
- **File**: `src/services/CardService.ts`
- **Removed**: Direct scope calculation logic from `drawCards()` and `discardCards()`
- **Removed**: GameRulesService dependency injection
- **Focus**: Service now purely handles card operations

**4. EffectEngineService Integration** ‚úÖ
- **File**: `src/services/EffectEngineService.ts`
- **Added**: GameRulesService injection and `RECALCULATE_SCOPE` case processing
- **Logic**: Unified effect processing ensures proper sequencing and persistence

#### **Key Benefits Achieved**
1. **Unified Processing**: All scope updates flow through Effect Engine
2. **Consistent Sequencing**: Proper effect ordering ensures data integrity
3. **Source Independence**: Works for W cards from any game source
4. **Effect Persistence**: Scope updates properly integrated with other effects
5. **Architecture Compliance**: Maintains clean separation of concerns

**Development Status**: Polish and Harden phase delivering production stability with enhanced features and architectural improvements.

## Future Development Ideas

- **[Feature] AI Integration Settings Screen:** Create a new settings screen where players can connect to external AI APIs. This would allow for dynamically generating or enhancing game content, such as:
    - Sound effects and character voices.
    - New card ideas or fully generated card content.
