---

## üéØ Project Overview

The code2027 project represents a complete architectural refactor of the critically broken code2026 prototype. The primary objective was to eliminate severe technical debt while implementing modern software architecture patterns, transforming a prototype with Service Locator anti-patterns, God Objects, and event spaghetti into a robust, maintainable application.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Key Architectural Achievements

### ‚úÖ **1. Robust Service-Oriented Architecture Implementation**

Successfully implemented a clean, dependency-injected service architecture that completely eliminates the architectural anti-patterns of code2026:

```typescript
// Before (code2026): Service Locator anti-pattern
const gsm = window.GameStateManager; // 312 instances of this pattern

// After (code2027): Clean dependency injection
constructor(
  private dataService: DataService,
  private stateService: StateService,
  private resourceService: ResourceService
) {}
```

**Services Implemented**:
- **DataService**: Single source of truth for all CSV data access
- **StateService**: Immutable game state management
- **TurnService**: Turn progression and win condition handling
- **CardService**: Complete card lifecycle management
- **PlayerActionService**: Command pattern for all player actions
- **MovementService**: Movement logic and validation
- **GameRulesService**: Centralized business rule validation
- **EffectEngineService**: Unified game logic processing engine

### ‚úÖ **2. Creation of Unified Effect Engine**

The crown achievement of the refactor - a centralized system that standardizes all game event processing:

- **EffectFactory**: Converts raw CSV data into standardized Effect objects
- **8 Core Effect Types**: Discriminated union pattern for type-safe game actions
- **EffectEngineService**: Central processor orchestrating all game logic through specialized services

This eliminated code duplication, ensured consistent behavior, and created a single testable pipeline for all game mechanics.

### ‚úÖ **3. Complete Decoupling of Game Data from Game Logic**

Achieved complete separation between data storage (CSV files) and business logic:

- All data access flows through DataService
- EffectFactory translates data structures into executable effects
- Game logic operates on Effect objects, not raw CSV data
- Easy to change data formats without affecting game mechanics

### ‚úÖ **4. Successful Implementation of All Core Gameplay Mechanics**

All major game systems successfully implemented on the new architecture:

- **Multi-player gameplay** with proper turn progression
- **Complete card system** with 24 different card types and effects
- **Movement system** supporting choice, dice, and fixed movement
- **Win condition detection** and end game sequence
- **Real-time UI updates** through immutable state management

### ‚úÖ **5. Comprehensive E2E Testing Validation**

Created and executed a complete E2E testing suite that validated system stability:

- **E2E-01**: Happy path 2-player game flow validation
- **E2E-02**: Complex card mechanics with multi-player targeting
- **E2E-03**: Complex space entry with choice-based movement
- **E2E-04**: Edge cases gauntlet testing system robustness

The testing phase successfully identified and resolved several critical integration bugs, demonstrating the robustness of the new architecture.

## üé® Recent UI/UX Enhancement - August 29, 2025

### **Persistent Game Log System Implementation**

**Enhancement Overview**: Completed replacement of modal-based action feedback with a persistent game log system, significantly improving user experience and game flow.

#### **Key Improvements**
- **Persistent Action History**: All player actions now logged to a scrollable, persistent game log at the bottom of the screen
- **Real-time Updates**: Game log updates instantly as actions occur, providing immediate feedback
- **Enhanced Button Behavior**: Buttons transform into completion messages showing specific outcomes while maintaining permanent log history
- **Improved Game Flow**: Eliminated disruptive modal popups that previously interrupted gameplay

#### **Technical Implementation**
- **New Component**: `GameLog.tsx` - Scrollable, real-time action history with player-specific color coding
- **Shared Utilities**: `actionLogFormatting.ts` - Consistent action description formatting across components  
- **State Enhancement**: Added `globalActionLog` to game state for centralized logging
- **Architecture Compliance**: Full integration with existing service layer using dependency injection patterns

#### **User Experience Impact**
- **Before**: Modal popups interrupted game flow, action history was temporary
- **After**: Seamless continuous feedback with permanent action history
- **Result**: Significantly improved game usability and player engagement

This enhancement maintains the project's architectural principles while delivering a more polished, production-ready user experience.

- **[UI Polish]** The text on the "Cards" button should be dynamic, showing "Total available / active cards".
- **[UI Polish]** Reorganize the right column: Actions (e.g., Draw Card) on top, Controls (Negotiate, End Turn) on the bottom.
- **[UI Polish]** All action buttons should visually indicate if they are automatic or require player action.
- **[UI Polish]** All buttons should have a uniform look. Suggestion: Dark gray for active, light gray for inactive.

### 4. Project Scope and Financial Status Container

- **[Game Mechanic]** Reaching 20% cost overrun on design should trigger a game-end condition.
- **[Feature]** Need to track "Fees" and "Construction Costs" separately.
- **[Game Logic]** Money from `OWNER-FUND-INITIATION` spaces should be treated as "owner seed money" and not incur fees.

### 5. Card Portfolio Container

- **[UI Polish]** Card indicators in the portfolio should show the card name and the phase(s) they are active in.
- **[Bug]** Card details do not load. The modal is stuck on "loading card detail...".

### 6. Space Explorer

- **[Bug]** The "Close" button on the details panel does not work.

### 7. Game Board

- **[Feature]** The board should show available player actions as icons on the current space.
- **[Feature]** Restore the visual paths from the current space to available destination spaces.

### 8. Game Log

- **[UI Polish]** The log panel should be wider to prevent line wrapping.
- **[Feature]** The log should record every button press and player action, not just a subset.
- **[Feature]** The log should be sortable by player and by space.
- **[Feature]** Add the ability to save or print the log.
- **[UI Polish]** The log should be collapsed by default and expandable on click.

## Future Development Ideas

- **[Feature] AI Integration Settings Screen:** Create a new settings screen where players can connect to external AI APIs. This would allow for dynamically generating or enhancing game content, such as:
    - Sound effects and character voices.
    - New card ideas or fully generated card content.
