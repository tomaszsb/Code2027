## üêõ **CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE FLAW DISCOVERED - September 7, 2025**

### **üö® Issue: Card Service allows duplicate cards to be drawn**
**Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Stateful decks have been implemented in `StateService` and are used by `CardService`.

**Problem Description**:
A critical flaw has been identified in the card drawing logic. The current implementation in `CardService.drawCards()` does not use a stateful deck. Instead, it randomly selects from a master list of card templates from the CSV files.

**Impact**:
This allows the same card (e.g., L003) to be in multiple players' hands at the same time, which violates the fundamental rules of most card games and breaks the strategic balance.

### **üîç Root Cause Analysis**

The `CardService.drawCards` method is stateless. It fetches all possible cards of a given type from `DataService` and picks one at random. It does not track which cards have already been dealt from the "deck".

### **üéØ Resolution Plan**

A significant refactor of the card system is required to introduce stateful decks.

**Proposed Solution:**
1.  **Update Game State**: The `GameState` in `StateService` must be modified to include deck and discard piles for each card type (e.g., `w_deck: string[]`, `w_discard: string[]`).
2.  **Initialize Decks**: At the start of a new game, the `StateService` must populate and shuffle these decks with all unique card IDs from the `DataService`.
3.  **Refactor `CardService.drawCards`**: This method must be changed to:
    a.  Draw one or more cards from the top of the appropriate deck in the `GameState`.
    b.  Remove the drawn cards from that deck.
    c.  Place the drawn cards into the player's hand.
    d.  (Optional but recommended) Implement logic to reshuffle the discard pile into the deck if the deck runs out of cards.

This architectural change is necessary to ensure the integrity and fairness of the game's card mechanics.

## üêõ **CRITICAL BUG DISCOVERED (P2 BLOCKER) - September 7, 2025**

### **üö® Issue: `Card not found` in Automatic Funding Logic**
**Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - The atomic `drawAndApplyCard` method has been implemented in `CardService`, fixing the race condition.

**Problem Description**:
A critical bug was identified in the `handleAutomaticFunding` method within `TurnService.ts`. When a player lands on `OWNER-FUND-INITIATION` and qualifies for funding, the service throws a `Card ... not found` error.

### **üîç Root Cause Analysis**

The error is caused by a state consistency issue. The `handleAutomaticFunding` method performs two separate actions back-to-back:
1.  `cardService.drawCards()`: This method creates a new card and updates the game state.
2.  `cardService.playCard()`: This method is called immediately after, but it fails because the state update from the `drawCards` call has not been fully propagated or is not available in the current execution context. `playCard` attempts to find the card in the player's hand and fails.

This is a race condition within the service layer logic.

### **üéØ Resolution Plan**

To resolve this, a new, atomic method must be created in `CardService.ts` to ensure the entire transaction is handled in a single, state-safe operation.

**Proposed Solution:**
1.  **Create `drawAndApplyCard()` in `CardService.ts`**: This new public method will encapsulate the entire logic:
    *   Draw a new card.
    *   Apply its effects via `applyCardEffects()`.
    *   Move the card to the appropriate pile (e.g., discarded).
2.  **Refactor `handleAutomaticFunding` in `TurnService.ts`**: This method will be simplified to make a single call to the new `cardService.drawAndApplyCard()` method.

This architectural change will eliminate the race condition and ensure the automatic funding feature is robust and reliable.

### September 10, 2025 - UI/Data Discrepancy Analysis

- **Analysis:** A review of the `PM-DECISION-CHECK` space revealed significant discrepancies between the UI (as shown in `code2026/Screenshot_10-9-2025_23953_localhost.jpeg`) and the backing game data in `code2027` CSV files.
- **Key Discrepancies:**
    1.  **Incorrect Action Buttons:** The UI shows "Roll for Bonus Cards" and "Pick up 1 TRANSFER card". The data only supports a conditional roll for a single Life card and does not support the transfer card action at all.
    2.  **Missing Core Functionality:** The UI lacks the primary choice mechanism for path selection, which is the main purpose of the space according to `Spaces.csv`.
    3.  **Missing Turn Finalization:** No "End Turn" button exists to process the selected actions and consequences.
- **Action Item:** A set of tasks has been added to `todo.md` to address these UI/UX bugs and bring the interface in line with the game logic defined in the data files.

### September 11, 2025 - Critical System Fixes & Performance Analysis

#### ‚úÖ **E2E-05 Multi-Player Effects System Fixed**
- **Issue**: Multi-player card effects (e.g., L003 "All Players" targeting) were only affecting the playing player
- **Root Cause**: `PlayerActionService.playCard()` was calling `effectEngineService.processEffects()` instead of `processCardEffects()`, preventing access to card targeting data
- **Solution**: Fixed method call to use `processCardEffects()` with card data parameter
- **Impact**: All multi-player targeted card effects now work correctly across all players
- **Test Results**: All 4 E2E-05 tests now pass in 5.8 seconds (previously failing/timing out)

#### ‚úÖ **Game Load Time Performance Investigation Completed**
- **Investigation**: Comprehensive analysis of 20-30 second load time bottlenecks
- **Key Findings**: 
  - Large JavaScript bundle (414KB) due to monolithic services
  - 7 separate CSV network requests (115KB total data)
  - CPU-intensive CSV parsing on main thread
  - Complex service initialization patterns
- **Deliverable**: Detailed optimization roadmap with 75-85% improvement potential
- **Target**: Reduce load times from 20-30s to 4-6 seconds
- **Documentation**: Created `PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS.md` with implementation priorities

#### ‚úÖ **Test Suite Stability Restored**

### September 19, 2025 - Unified Notification System Implementation

#### ‚úÖ **Complete Notification System Consolidation**
- **Achievement**: Successfully unified three separate notification systems into single NotificationService engine
- **Systems Consolidated**:
  1. Button feedback (short messages with UI state)
  2. Per-player notification areas (medium-length blue notification zones)
  3. GameLog entries (detailed action history)

#### üèóÔ∏è **Technical Implementation**
- **NotificationService.ts**: Created unified engine managing all three output channels with callback system
- **NotificationUtils.ts**: Utility functions generating short/medium/detailed message variants from single source
- **Component Integration**: Updated GameLayout, TurnControlsWithActions, and ChoiceModal for consistent feedback

#### üìã **Key Features Delivered**
- **Single API**: All user actions now use one `notificationService.notify()` call
- **Three Output Formats**: Automatic generation of appropriate message length for each UI channel
- **Immediate Feedback**: Button clicks, choice selections, and movement actions provide instant user response
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing component interfaces preserved while internally using new system

#### üéØ **User Experience Improvements**
- **Consistent Messaging**: Unified terminology and formatting across all notification channels
- **Immediate Response**: Users get instant feedback for all interactive elements
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed action history maintained in GameLog
- **Professional UI**: Clean notification areas without UI disruption

**Status**: Notification system architecture complete. All user interactions now provide consistent, immediate feedback through unified engine.
