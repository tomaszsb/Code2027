- ✅ **Win Condition System:** Automated detection when players reach ending spaces
- ✅ **End Game Sequence:** Celebration modal with play-again functionality
- ✅ **Card System:** 24 different cards with play validation and effects
- ✅ **Movement System:** Choice, dice, and fixed movement types
- ✅ **State Management:** Immutable state with real-time UI updates
- ✅ **Service Architecture:** Clean separation of concerns with dependency injection

### **Technical Excellence Achieved**
- ✅ **Architecture:** Service-oriented design eliminating all anti-patterns
- ✅ **Type Safety:** 100% TypeScript coverage with strict mode
- ✅ **Testing:** Comprehensive unit and integration test suites
- ✅ **Performance:** Optimized state management with efficient subscriptions
- ✅ **User Experience:** Intuitive UI with real-time feedback and error handling
