## Bug 1: CardModal Data Display Issue ‚úÖ **FIXED**

### Problem
- **Symptom**: Cards in Hand Show No Data When Clicked
- **Impact**: CardModal displays no information when players click cards from their hand
- **User Experience**: Players unable to view card details, breaking card inspection functionality

### Root Cause Analysis
The TurnService was generating completely random dynamic card IDs (format: `W_timestamp_random_index`) that had no relationship to the actual card data stored in `CARDS.csv`. When the CardModal attempted to find card data by matching these dynamic IDs with static CSV card IDs (like `W001`, `W002`), no matches were found.

### Technical Solution
**Files Modified**:
- `src/services/TurnService.ts`
- `src/components/modals/CardModal.tsx`

**Implementation**:
1. **New Card ID Generation**: Implemented `generateCardIds()` method that creates dynamic IDs starting with actual CSV card IDs
   - **Old Format**: `W_1234567890_abcdefg` (completely random)
   - **New Format**: `W001_1234567890_abcdefg_0` (starts with static CSV ID)

2. **Enhanced CardModal Data Loading**: Added DataService loading checks to prevent card lookup before data is ready

3. **Updated All Card Drawing Methods**: Modified `draw_w`, `draw_b`, `draw_e`, `draw_l`, `draw_i`, `replace_e`, `replace_l` to use new generation system

### Result
- ‚úÖ Players can now click cards in their hand and see proper card information
- ‚úÖ CardModal displays card name, description, effects, and costs correctly
- ‚úÖ Zero data loss - all original functionality preserved with proper data mapping

## Bug 2: Player Money/Time Not Updating in UI üîç **INVESTIGATED**

### Problem
- **Symptom**: Work Types Added and Associated Costs Do Not Show Up on the Player Area
- **Impact**: Player money and time values not updating in UI after taking turns
- **User Experience**: Players can't see their resource changes, breaking game progression feedback

### Investigation Conducted
**Analysis Completed**:
1. **State Service Verification**: Confirmed `StateService.updatePlayer()` properly calls `notifyListeners()`
2. **UI Subscription Verification**: Confirmed `PlayerStatusPanel` correctly subscribes to state changes  
3. **Effect Processing Chain**: Verified both human and AI players call effect processing methods
4. **Service Integration**: Confirmed `PlayerActionService.rollDice()` calls `TurnService.processTurnEffects()`

**Debug Infrastructure Added**:
- Added comprehensive debug logging to `TurnService.processTurnEffects()` method
- Logs show: space effects found, effects being applied, and effect values
- Console logging format: `üéØ Processing turn effects for [Player] on [Space] ([Visit] visit)`

### Root Cause Identified ‚úÖ
**Property Name Mismatch**: Code2026 used `player.timeSpent` while code2027 used `player.time`
- **Problem**: Effects were updating `time` property but UI was displaying `timeSpent` 
- **Discovery**: Access to code2026 revealed original property naming convention
- **Evidence**: GameStateManager.js line 1048, PlayerResources.js lines 40 & 127

### Technical Solution ‚úÖ
**Files Modified**:
- `src/types/DataTypes.ts` - Changed Player interface from `time: number` to `timeSpent: number`
- `src/services/StateService.ts` - Changed initial player state from `time: 0` to `timeSpent: 0`
- `src/services/TurnService.ts` - Updated effect processing to use `player.timeSpent` and update `timeSpent` property
- `src/components/game/PlayerStatusItem.tsx` - Changed display from `{player.time}m` to `{player.timeSpent || 0} days`

### Result ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Property naming now consistent throughout system
- ‚úÖ Effects processing updates correct property (`timeSpent`)
- ‚úÖ UI displays correct property (`timeSpent`)
- ‚úÖ Build compilation successful with TypeScript updates
- ‚úÖ Display format matches code2026 ("X days" instead of "Xm")

## Bug 3: Roll Dice Button Remaining Active ‚úÖ **FIXED**

### Problem
- **Symptom**: Button Does Not Become Inactive During Processing
- **Impact**: Roll Dice button remains active during processing, allowing double-clicking
- **User Experience**: Players can accidentally trigger multiple actions, causing race conditions

### Root Cause Analysis  
The `TurnControls` component was only checking `isProcessingTurn` for button availability, but not tracking the comprehensive turn state flags:
- Missing: `hasPlayerMovedThisTurn` flag (prevents rolling after already rolling)
- Missing: `awaitingChoice` flag (prevents rolling while waiting for choice selection)

### Technical Solution
**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/game/TurnControls.tsx`

**Implementation**:
1. **Enhanced State Management**:
   ```typescript
   const [hasPlayerMovedThisTurn, setHasPlayerMovedThisTurn] = useState(false);
   const [awaitingChoice, setAwaitingChoice] = useState(false);
   ```

2. **Updated State Subscription**: Extract `hasPlayerMovedThisTurn` and `awaitingChoice` from GameState

3. **Enhanced Button Logic**:
   ```typescript
   const canRollDice = gamePhase === 'PLAY' && isHumanPlayerTurn && 
                      !isProcessingTurn && !hasPlayerMovedThisTurn && !awaitingChoice;
   const canEndTurn = gamePhase === 'PLAY' && isHumanPlayerTurn && 
                     !isProcessingTurn && hasPlayerMovedThisTurn && !awaitingChoice;
   ```

### Result
- ‚úÖ Roll Dice button properly disabled during processing
- ‚úÖ Roll Dice button disabled after player has already moved  
- ‚úÖ End Turn button only enabled after player has rolled dice
- ‚úÖ Prevents double-clicking and race conditions

## Bug 4: End Turn Button Not Advancing Turns ‚úÖ **FIXED**

### Problem
- **Symptom**: Button Does Not End Turn - End Turn button doesn't advance game to next player  
- **Impact**: Players stuck on their turn, unable to progress game flow
- **User Experience**: Game becomes unplayable after first turn

### Root Cause Analysis
The `PlayerActionService.rollDice()` method was not calling `stateService.setPlayerHasMoved()` after processing the dice roll. This meant:
1. Human players roll dice via `playerActionService.rollDice()`
2. Method processes effects but doesn't set `hasPlayerMovedThisTurn = true`
3. `canEndTurn` condition remains `false`  
4. End Turn button stays disabled

**Key Discovery**: AI players worked correctly because they used `TurnService.takeTurn()` which properly calls `setPlayerHasMoved()`, but human players used different code path.

### Technical Solution
**Files Modified**:
- `src/services/PlayerActionService.ts`

**Implementation**:
Added missing state update in `rollDice()` method:
```typescript
// 6. Mark that the player has moved this turn (enables End Turn button)
this.stateService.setPlayerHasMoved();
```

**Verification**: Confirmed `TurnService.endTurn()` properly:
- Sets next player: `this.stateService.setCurrentPlayer(nextPlayer.id)`
- Advances turn counter: `this.stateService.advanceTurn()`
- Clears movement flag: `this.stateService.clearPlayerHasMoved()`

### Result
- ‚úÖ End Turn button now becomes enabled after human players roll dice
- ‚úÖ End Turn button properly advances to next player
- ‚úÖ Turn progression works for both human and AI players
- ‚úÖ Multi-action turn system fully functional

## Bug 5: Negotiate Button Wrong Behavior ‚úÖ **FIXED**

### Problem
- **Symptom**: Negotiate Button Asks for Another Player  
- **Impact**: Different behavior from code2026 version - button shows "No other players available for negotiation!" instead of space-specific negotiation
- **User Experience**: Confusing behavior that doesn't match game's space-based mechanics

### Root Cause Analysis
Original implementation only supported player-to-player negotiation, completely ignoring the space-specific negotiation rules defined in the CSV data. Analysis of `SPACE_CONTENT.csv` revealed:
- Many spaces have `can_negotiate: Yes` flag
- Space descriptions reference negotiation as space-specific actions (re-rolling, modifying outcomes)
- Examples: "You can take it or waste time and hope to renegotiate next turn"

### Technical Solution
**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/game/TurnControls.tsx`

**Implementation**:
1. **Space-Based Negotiation Check**:
   ```typescript
   const spaceContent = dataService.getSpaceContent(currentPlayer.currentSpace, currentPlayer.visitType);
   if (spaceContent && spaceContent.can_negotiate === 'Yes') {
     // Space-specific negotiation available
   }
   ```

2. **Prioritized Logic**:
   - **Primary**: Check if current space allows negotiation
   - **Secondary**: Fall back to player-to-player negotiation if space doesn't support it
   - **Enhanced Messaging**: Informative alerts explaining negotiation availability

### Result
- ‚úÖ Negotiate button now checks space-specific rules first
- ‚úÖ Proper space-based negotiation messaging  
- ‚úÖ Maintains backward compatibility with player-to-player negotiation
- ‚úÖ Behavior aligned with CSV-driven game rules
