## b600d5a - feat(notifications): Fix Action Notification visibility by moving logic to service layer
**Date**: 2025-09-21 09:27:26
**Author**: tomaszsb <tomaszsb@gmail.com>

Resolved critical issue where Action Notifications (blue boxes) were being created correctly but immediately cleared by auto-clearing logic during turn transitions. Users never saw feedback for End Turn, Manual Effects, Automatic Funding, and Try Again actions.

**Root cause**: Notifications were sent from UI components during state transitions, causing timing conflicts with React batching and auto-clearing logic.

**Solution**: Moved notification sending from GameLayout to TurnService where notifications are sent AFTER all state changes complete. This ensures notifications persist for their full configured duration.

**Changes:**
- Added NotificationService dependency to TurnService
- Implemented notifications in nextPlayer(), triggerManualEffectWithFeedback(), handleAutomaticFunding(), tryAgainOnSpace()
- Updated ServiceProvider to inject NotificationService into TurnService
- Simplified GameLayout action handlers to remove notification logic
- Removed debug logging added during troubleshooting

**Results:**
- All action notifications now display correctly and persist
- Clean separation between UI interaction and business logic notifications
- Improved user experience with reliable action feedback

## 8ee672b - feat(game-logic): Complete PM-DECISION-CHECK fixes and game action independence
**Date**: 2025-09-20 13:32:10
**Author**: tomaszsb <tomaszsb@gmail.com>

**Core Changes:**
- Fixed manual action buttons showing completion messages instead of clickable buttons
- Made manual actions and movement choices properly independent
- Fixed callback synchronization between NotificationService and React state
- Resolved Try Again regression with proper snapshot management

**Technical Implementation:**

- TurnService.ts: Corrected Try Again logic to avoid premature turn advancement
- MovementService.ts: Removed premature snapshot saving causing false detection

**Game Design Fix:**
- Players can now perform actions in any order (roll dice → choose movement)
- Movement choices no longer block dice rolls or manual space effects
- Matches proper board game mechanics with strategic flexibility

**Test Coverage:**
- Added comprehensive component tests for modal notifications
- Updated E2E tests for Try Again functionality
- Enhanced mock services for better test isolation

## fc5f8e2 - feat(notifications): Implement unified notification system architecture
**Date**: 2025-09-19 00:49:10
**Author**: tomaszsb <tomaszsb@gmail.com>

Replace three separate notification systems (button feedback, player notifications, GameLog) with single NotificationService engine. All user interactions now provide consistent immediate feedback through unified API generating short/medium/detailed message variants.

**Key Features:**
- NotificationService.ts: Single engine managing all three output channels
- NotificationUtils.ts: Message variant generation utilities
- Integrated across GameLayout, TurnControlsWithActions, ChoiceModal
- Backward compatibility maintained for existing component interfaces
- Immediate user feedback for all interactive elements

**Technical Changes:**
- 18 files modified, 504 insertions, 209 deletions
- Service-oriented architecture with callback-based UI updates
- TypeScript interface updates across component hierarchy
- Comprehensive test compatibility maintained

## 29d67f6 - feat(timing): Fix time effects to apply when leaving spaces + comprehensive Try Again improvements
**Date**: 2025-09-17 23:30:22
**Author**: tomaszsb <tomaszsb@gmail.com>

### Core Timing Fix
- **Time effects now apply when leaving spaces** instead of when entering
- Represents time spent working on activities at that space
- Fixes logical inconsistency where time was added before work was done

### Try Again System Overhaul
- **Multi-player support**: Player-aware snapshots prevent cross-player interference
- **Multiple attempts**: Players can Try Again multiple times with accumulating time penalties
- **Button state reset**: All action buttons properly reset after Try Again
- **Turn progression**: Next player correctly called in multi-player games
- **Starting space support**: Snapshots created on game start for immediate Try Again availability

### Technical Implementation
- Modified `TurnService.processTurnEffects()` to exclude time effects
- Added `TurnService.processLeavingSpaceEffects()` for time processing on space exit
- Enhanced snapshot system with `snapshotPlayerId` and `snapshotSpaceName` tracking
- Updated `MovementService` to create snapshots immediately after movement
- Fixed button states (`hasPlayerRolledDice`, `hasCompletedManualActions`) reset in Try Again
- Preserved turn context (`currentPlayerId`, `turn`) when restoring snapshots

- UI state colors (hover, active, disabled, focus states)
- Extended text variants and accessibility-ready color system
- Enterprise-ready for dark mode, brand changes, accessibility

### 🧪 Complete TypeScript Error Resolution:
- Fix all theme-related syntax errors across 13 files
- Resolve import conflicts and circular dependencies
- Update all service interfaces and mock implementations
- Achieve 0 TypeScript compilation errors with strict mode
