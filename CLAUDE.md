## 🎮 **GAME LOG & TURN SEQUENCE ARCHITECTURE** (September 25, 2025)

### **Objective**
A full-stack refactor was completed to fix systemic issues in the game log and turn sequence. The goal was to create a robust, sequential, and easily understandable log of game events.

### **Key Architectural Principles**

1.  **The Log Follows the Logic:** The primary principle is that the Game Log is an accurate reflection of the game's state machine. If the log is out of sequence, it means the game logic is out of sequence.

2.  **Unified Turn Start:** There is a single, unified function (`TurnService.startTurn`) that controls the beginning of every player's turn, including the first turn of the game. This function is responsible for establishing the correct sequence of events:
    1.  Lock UI (`isProcessingArrival = true`)
    2.  Save "Try Again" Snapshot
    3.  Process Arrival Effects
    4.  Unlock UI (`isProcessingArrival = false`)

3.  **Intelligent, Centralized Logging:** The `LoggingService` is the single source of truth for creating log entries. It is designed to be "smart" and infer the correct log `type` from the message content, even if the calling service provides incomplete information.

4.  **Data-Driven UI:** The `GameLog.tsx` component is a "dumb" component. It correctly renders parent/child groups based on the `type` of the log entries it receives. All grouping and ordering logic is derived from the chronological `actionLog` array from the `StateService`.

### **Known Issue**
- The final step of the refactor, which involves updating `GameLayout.tsx` to call the unified `startTurn` function, has not been implemented. As a result, the first turn of the game remains out of sequence.
