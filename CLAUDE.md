## ðŸŽ® **GAME LOG & TURN SEQUENCE ARCHITECTURE** (September 25, 2025)

### **Objective**
A full-stack refactor was completed to fix systemic issues in the game log and turn sequence. The goal was to create a robust, sequential, and easily understandable log of game events.

### **Key Architectural Principles**

1.  **The Log Follows the Logic:** The primary principle is that the Game Log is an accurate reflection of the game's state machine. If the log is out of sequence, it means the game logic is out of sequence.

2.  **Unified Turn Start:** There is a single, unified function (`TurnService.startTurn`) that controls the beginning of every player's turn, including the first turn of the game. This function is responsible for establishing the correct sequence of events:
    1.  Lock UI (`isProcessingArrival = true`)
    2.  Save "Try Again" Snapshot
    3.  Process Arrival Effects
    4.  Unlock UI (`isProcessingArrival = false`)

3.  **Intelligent, Centralized Logging:** The `LoggingService` is the single source of truth for creating log entries. It is designed to be "smart" and infer the correct log `type` from the message content, even if the calling service provides incomplete information.

4.  **Data-Driven UI:** The `GameLog.tsx` component is a "dumb" component. It correctly renders parent/child groups based on the `type` of the log entries it receives. All grouping and ordering logic is derived from the chronological `actionLog` array from the `StateService`.

### **âœ… RESOLVED ISSUES** (September 28, 2025)

All previously identified issues have been successfully resolved:

1. **Fixed First Turn Sequence:** Updated `TurnControls.tsx` to call the unified `startTurn` function, ensuring all game initialization paths follow the proper sequence.

2. **Fixed Turn Numbering:** Turn display is now 1-based instead of 0-based (shows "Turn 1 started" instead of "Turn 0 started").

3. **System Log Management:** System logs now start collapsed by default to reduce UI clutter while remaining accessible for debugging.

4. **Unified System Grouping:** Fixed case-sensitive filtering that was causing multiple System sections in the game log.

### **Current Implementation Status**
- âœ… **Complete Turn Sequence Control:** All turns (including first turn) follow the unified sequence
- âœ… **Proper Turn Start Logging:** Every turn gets a "Turn X started" log entry
- âœ… **Clean UI Experience:** System logs minimized, player actions prominent
- âœ… **Consistent Log Grouping:** Single System section, proper player grouping
- âœ… **Architectural Principles Followed:** "The Log Follows the Logic" fully implemented
