## 🏗️ Architecture Foundation

**CRITICAL PRINCIPLE**: Build clean, service-oriented architecture with dependency injection. The `code2026` reference codebase contains anti-patterns - study it to understand what NOT to do.

## ✅ Architecture Patterns (Current Implementation)

### Core Services (ALL COMPLETED):
```typescript
DataService.ts          // ✅ CSV data access with caching
StateService.ts         // ✅ Immutable game state management  
TurnService.ts          // ✅ Turn progression + win conditions
CardService.ts          // ✅ Card operations + validation
PlayerActionService.ts  // ✅ Command orchestration
MovementService.ts      // ✅ Movement logic + validation
GameRulesService.ts     // ✅ Business rules + validation
```

### Key Patterns to Follow:
- **Dependency Injection**: `constructor(private serviceA: IServiceA)`
- **Immutable State**: `return { ...player, ...changes }`  
- **Service Integration**: `const { dataService } = useGameContext()`
- **TypeScript Strict**: All code fully typed with interfaces

## 🎮 Current Game Features (COMPLETE)

- **✅ Complete Game Loop**: Start → Setup → Play → Win → Reset
- **✅ Multi-Player Support**: Turn-based gameplay with AI and human players  
- **✅ Card System**: 24 different cards with play validation and effects
- **✅ Movement System**: Choice, dice, and fixed movement types
- **✅ Win Condition System**: Automatic detection and end game sequence
- **✅ Real-time UI**: Immutable state with instant UI updates

## 🎨 Enhanced UI Features (NEW - August 25, 2025)

- **✅ Card Replacement Modal**: Interactive card selection and replacement interface
- **✅ Movement Path Visualization**: Real-time movement options and path display
- **✅ Space Explorer Panel**: Comprehensive space browser with search and filtering

## 🧠 Effect Condition System (NEW - August 26, 2025)

- **✅ Data-Driven Condition Evaluation**: All effect conditions evaluated from CSV data
- **✅ Project Scope Conditions**: `scope_le_4M`, `scope_gt_4M` based on player's work cards
- **✅ Dice Roll Conditions**: `dice_roll_1` through `dice_roll_6` for specific roll requirements  
- **✅ Loan Amount Conditions**: `loan_up_to_1_4m`, `loan_1_5m_to_2_75m`, `loan_above_2_75m`
- **✅ Universal Conditions**: `always`, `high`, `low` and other data-driven conditions
- **✅ Proper Action Counting**: Automatic effects don't count as separate actions

## 📂 Data Architecture 

**CRITICAL**: Game loads CSV data from `/public/data/CLEAN_FILES/` directory (not root `/data/`)

### CSV Files (COMPLETE):
- `GAME_CONFIG.csv` - Space configuration, phases, starting positions
- `MOVEMENT.csv` - Space-to-space connections and movement rules
- `CARDS.csv` - 24 cards with types, costs, and effects
- `SPACE_CONTENT.csv` - UI text and story content
- `SPACE_EFFECTS.csv` + `DICE_EFFECTS.csv` - Game effects and mechanics
- `DICE_OUTCOMES.csv` - Dice roll destination mapping

### Data Access Pattern:
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT: Always use DataService
const cards = dataService.getCardsByType('W');
const config = dataService.getGameConfigBySpace(spaceName);

// ❌ NEVER: Direct CSV access or hardcoded data
```

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

```bash
cd /mnt/d/unravel/current_game/code2027
npm run dev           # Start development server (usually port 3007)
npm run build         # Build for production  
npm run test          # Run test suite
```

## 📚 Documentation Quick Reference

- **`DEVELOPMENT.md`** - Current project status and any remaining priorities  
- **Service Contracts**: `src/types/ServiceContracts.ts` - All service interfaces
- **CSV Structure**: `CSV_RESTRUCTURE_PLAN.md` - Data file specifications

## 🎯 Development Focus

**Current Status**: Core game is production-ready and fully playable

**For New Features**:
1. Follow established service patterns with dependency injection
2. Use DataService for all CSV data access  
3. Maintain TypeScript strict typing
4. Add comprehensive tests for new functionality
5. Keep components under 200 lines

**Key Architecture Reminder**: Always use services through `useGameContext()` hook in components. Never access data directly.

## 📝 Recent Work Log

### August 23, 2025: Complete Bug Fix Session ✅
**ALL 5 Critical Bugs Successfully Resolved**

1. **CardModal Data Display Issue** ✅  
   - **Problem**: Cards showing no data when clicked  
   - **Root Cause**: Dynamic card IDs not mapping to static CSV card data  
   - **Fix**: Implemented proper card ID generation starting with CSV card IDs

2. **Player Money/Time Not Updating** ✅  
   - **Problem**: UI not reflecting player money/time changes  
   - **Root Cause**: Property name mismatch - code2026 used `timeSpent`, code2027 used `time`  
   - **Fix**: Updated all code to use consistent `timeSpent` property naming

3. **Roll Dice Button Remaining Active** ✅  
   - **Problem**: Button not becoming inactive during processing  
   - **Root Cause**: Missing turn state management (`hasPlayerMovedThisTurn`, `awaitingChoice`)  
   - **Fix**: Enhanced button logic with proper state tracking

4. **End Turn Button Not Advancing Turns** ✅  
   - **Problem**: End Turn button not progressing to next player  
   - **Root Cause**: `PlayerActionService.rollDice()` not calling `setPlayerHasMoved()`  
   - **Fix**: Added missing state update to enable End Turn button

5. **Negotiate Button Wrong Behavior** ✅  
   - **Problem**: Button asking for other players instead of space-specific negotiation  
   - **Root Cause**: Missing space-based negotiation logic  
   - **Fix**: Implemented space content checking for `can_negotiate` flag

**Result**: Game now has proper turn progression, card functionality, and UI state management

## CRITICAL BUG FIXES COMPLETED - December 2024 ✅

### **Session Summary: Multi-Action Turn System & W Card Data Fixes**

**Date**: December 2024  
**Scope**: Fixed 5 critical bugs impacting game functionality and user experience

#### **Major Architectural Fix: Multi-Action Turn System**
**Problem**: Game was auto-advancing players on dice roll, breaking proper turn flow  
**Solution**: Completely separated dice rolling from movement:

1. **Roll Dice Button**: Now calls `TurnService.rollDiceAndProcessEffects()` 
   - Rolls dice + processes space/dice effects + marks player as moved
   - **Does NOT** move player to next space
2. **End Turn Button**: Now calls `TurnService.endTurnWithMovement()`
   - Handles movement + advances to next player + checks win condition
   - **Only available after** player has rolled dice

#### **Critical Data Fix: W Cards Show Construction Work Scope**
**Problem**: W cards showed generic planning content instead of construction work scopes  
**Root Cause**: Wrong CSV data - 2027 had placeholder cards instead of 2026 construction projects  
**Solution**: 
- Replaced W cards with correct construction work types from 2026
- W cards now show actual projects like "Lobby renovation", "Attic conversion", "Green wall installation"
- Set W cards to cost $0 (scope assignments, not purchases)
- Added estimated costs in descriptions for funding planning

#### **Data Structure Consolidation**
**Problem**: 3 copies of CARDS.csv causing confusion and deployment issues  
**Solution**: Consolidated to single source of truth in `/public/data/CLEAN_FILES/`
- ❌ Removed `/data/CLEAN_FILES/` (redundant)
- ❌ Removed `/dist/data/` (build output)  
- ✅ Kept `/public/data/CLEAN_FILES/` (web server source)

#### **UI Enhancement: Player Cards Show Work Scope**
**Problem**: W card buttons only showed "W" instead of actual work descriptions  
**Solution**: Enhanced PlayerStatusPanel to display:
- **Before**: `W` `W` `W` (meaningless)
- **After**: `Conversion of attic space...` `Lobby renovation...` (meaningful scope)
- Added tooltips with full descriptions and estimated costs

#### **Negotiation Button Fix**
**Problem**: Button showed "unavailable" despite `canNegotiate: true` in CSV  
**Root Cause**: Type mismatch - checking `=== 'Yes'` (string) vs `=== true` (boolean)  
**Solution**: Fixed comparison in TurnControls.tsx

#### **Game Flow Now Complete**
1. **Setup Phase**: Create players → Start game
2. **Turn Phase**: Roll dice (get cards/effects) → End turn (move to next space)  
3. **Win Phase**: Reach ending space → End game celebration
4. **Reset**: Play again button returns to setup

**Development Status**: Core game complete and production-ready with critical bugs resolved.

## 🛠️ Critical Fixes - August 26, 2025 ✅

### **Effect Condition Evaluation System**
**Status**: Complete implementation of data-driven effect condition evaluation

#### **Problem Solved**
- **Issue**: All CSV effect conditions (scope_le_4M, dice_roll_X, etc.) were logged but never evaluated
- **Impact**: Effects like "Draw B card if scope ≤ $4M" always applied regardless of actual scope
- **Root Cause**: Missing condition evaluation logic in effect processing

#### **Solution Implemented**
**File**: `src/services/TurnService.ts`

1. **Added `evaluateEffectCondition()` method**:
   ```typescript
   private evaluateEffectCondition(playerId: string, condition: string | undefined, diceRoll?: number): boolean
   ```

2. **Comprehensive condition support**:
   - `scope_le_4M` / `scope_gt_4M` - Project scope evaluation
   - `dice_roll_1` through `dice_roll_6` - Dice-specific conditions
   - `always` - Universal application
   - Loan amount, direction, and percentage conditions

3. **Project scope calculation**:
   ```typescript
   private calculateProjectScope(player: Player): number
   ```

4. **Integration points**:
   - Space effects: Condition checked before applying
   - Dice effects: Proper handling of roll_X structure
   - Manual effects: Condition validation before trigger

### **Action Counting Logic Fix**
**Status**: Fixed phantom action counting issue

#### **Problem Solved**
- **Issue**: Players saw "4/4 actions completed" but only had 1-2 actual actions available
- **Impact**: Confusing UI showing phantom actions with no buttons
- **Root Cause**: Automatic effects counted as separate required actions

#### **Solution Implemented**
**File**: `src/services/StateService.ts`

1. **Removed automatic effects from required action count**:
   - Time, money, card effects with `trigger_type !== 'manual'` are now triggered by dice roll
   - Only manual effects and dice roll count as required actions

2. **Proper action calculation**:
   - PM-DECISION-CHECK: 2 actions (dice + manual replace)
   - OWNER-FUND-INITIATION: 1 action (dice only)
   - OWNER-SCOPE-INITIATION: 2 actions (dice + manual draw)

#### **Technical Details**
- **Before**: `Required=4, Types=[time_auto, cards_auto, cards_auto, dice_roll]`
- **After**: `Required=2, Types=[cards_manual, dice_roll]`

#### **Files Modified**
- `src/services/TurnService.ts` - Condition evaluation system
- `src/services/StateService.ts` - Action counting fixes
- `src/components/game/TurnControls.tsx` - Enhanced debugging

**Result**: Game now properly evaluates all CSV conditions and shows accurate action counts.

### **RECALCULATE_SCOPE Effect Architecture** 
**Status**: Critical bug fix implementing dedicated effect type for consistent scope updates

#### **Problem Solved**
Project Scope was not updating correctly due to processing order issues in the effect system. Direct scope calculation in CardService bypassed the unified effect processing, causing inconsistencies.

#### **Solution Architecture**

**1. New Effect Type** ✅
- **File**: `src/types/EffectTypes.ts`
- **Added**: `RECALCULATE_SCOPE` effect with `{ playerId: string }` payload
- **Added**: `isRecalculateScopeEffect()` type guard function

**2. EffectFactory Enhancement** ✅
- **File**: `src/utils/EffectFactory.ts`
- **Enhancement**: Automatically generates `RECALCULATE_SCOPE` effects alongside `CARD_DRAW` effects for W cards
- **Coverage**: Card effects, space effects, dice effects
- **Logic**: Any W card acquisition triggers scope recalculation

**3. CardService Refactoring** ✅
- **File**: `src/services/CardService.ts`
- **Removed**: Direct scope calculation logic from `drawCards()` and `discardCards()`
- **Removed**: GameRulesService dependency injection
- **Focus**: Service now purely handles card operations

**4. EffectEngineService Integration** ✅
- **File**: `src/services/EffectEngineService.ts`
- **Added**: GameRulesService injection and `RECALCULATE_SCOPE` case processing
- **Logic**: Unified effect processing ensures proper sequencing and persistence

#### **Technical Data Flow**
```
W Card Event → EffectFactory → [CARD_DRAW, RECALCULATE_SCOPE] → EffectEngineService
                                      ↓                               ↓
                                 CardService                   GameRulesService

## 🎯 Action Feedback System & Persistent Logging - August 29, 2025 ✅

### **Major UI/UX Overhaul: Modal Replacement with Persistent Game Log**
**Date**: August 29, 2025  
**Scope**: Complete replacement of modal-based action feedback with persistent logging system

#### **Problem Statement**
User reported that the "Roll Dice" button was displaying incorrect contextual text, showing time-related effects when it should show card-related effects for dice outcomes. Investigation revealed deeper architectural issues with the action feedback system.

#### **Root Cause Analysis** ✅
1. **Effect Categorization Confusion**: StateService was incorrectly logging automatic space effects as "triggered by dice roll"
2. **Mixed Effect Processing**: TurnService was combining space effects with dice effects in `processTurnEffects`
3. **Modal State Conflicts**: Manual actions were overwriting dice roll logs due to shared modal state
4. **UI Context Loss**: Button transformation behavior was lost during modal removal

#### **Comprehensive Solution Implementation**

**1. Effect Separation & Logging Fixes** ✅
- **File**: `src/services/StateService.ts`
  - Fixed logging text from "triggered by dice roll" to "triggered by space entry" for automatic effects
  - Added `globalActionLog: ActionLogEntry[]` to GameState for centralized logging
  - Implemented `logToActionHistory()` method for unified action logging

- **File**: `src/services/TurnService.ts`  
  - Created separate `processDiceRollEffects()` method to handle only dice effects
  - Fixed player property references from `player.cards` to correct properties
  - Separated dice effect processing from automatic space effect processing

**2. Persistent Game Log Implementation** ✅
- **File**: `src/components/game/GameLog.tsx` (NEW)
  - Created scrollable, persistent game log component
  - Real-time subscription to global action log with instant updates
  - Player-specific color coding and timestamps
  - Comprehensive action formatting with icons and descriptions

- **File**: `src/utils/actionLogFormatting.ts` (NEW)
  - Shared formatting utility for consistent action descriptions
  - Icon-based categorization (🎲 dice, 🎴 cards, ⚡ effects, 📍 movement)
  - Extracted from component logic for reusability

**3. Modal System Replacement** ✅  
- **File**: `src/components/game/TurnControlsWithActions.tsx`
  - **REMOVED**: All modal dependencies and handlers (`showDiceResultModal`, `showManualActionModal`)
  - **REMOVED**: Modal confirmation workflows (`handleDiceResultConfirm`, `handleManualActionConfirm`)
  - **REPLACED**: Direct logging to global action history with immediate UI feedback
  - **PRESERVED**: Button transformation behavior with local completion messages

**4. Button Transformation Restoration** ✅
- **Issue**: Modal removal broke key feature where buttons transform into completion messages
- **Solution**: Dual-state system with global logging + local completion messages
- **Implementation**: 
  ```typescript
  const [completedActions, setCompletedActions] = useState<{
    diceRoll?: string;
    manualActions: { [effectType: string]: string };
  }>({ manualActions: {} });
  ```
- **Behavior**: Buttons show specific completion messages while also logging to global history

**5. Critical Bug Fix: Completion Message Loss** ✅
- **Problem**: Dice completion messages were being lost when manual actions were performed
- **Root Cause**: Aggressive state reset during component initialization (`null` → `playerId` transition)
- **Fix**: Modified turn change detection to only reset on actual player-to-player transitions
- **Code Change**:
  ```typescript
  // Only reset if it's actually a different player (not null → player transition)
  if (lastTurnPlayerId !== null && gameState.currentPlayerId !== lastTurnPlayerId) {
    setCompletedActions({ manualActions: {} });
  }
  ```

#### **Technical Architecture Improvements**

**Data Flow Enhancement**:
```
User Action → TurnService/PlayerActionService → StateService.logToActionHistory()
                                                       ↓
Global Action Log ← ← ← ← ← ← StateService.subscribe() → GameLog Component
       ↓                                                       ↓
Local Completion State ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← TurnControls Component
       ↓
Button Transformation
```

**Key Benefits Achieved**:
1. **Persistent History**: All actions permanently logged and searchable
2. **Real-time Updates**: Global log updates instantly across all UI components  
3. **Dual Feedback**: Immediate button feedback + persistent log history
4. **Clean Architecture**: Removed modal complexity while maintaining UX
5. **Consistent Formatting**: Unified action descriptions with proper categorization
6. **No Data Loss**: Button completion messages persist correctly across action sequences

#### **Files Modified**
- `src/services/StateService.ts` - Global logging system and effect categorization fixes
- `src/services/TurnService.ts` - Effect separation and dice roll processing
- `src/components/game/TurnControlsWithActions.tsx` - Modal removal and completion state management
- `src/components/game/GameLog.tsx` - New persistent log component
- `src/utils/actionLogFormatting.ts` - New shared formatting utility
- `src/components/layout/GameLayout.tsx` - GameLog integration
- `src/types/StateTypes.ts` - ActionLogEntry interface and globalActionLog property

#### **User Experience Impact**
- **Before**: Modal popups interrupted game flow, actions lost on dismissal
- **After**: Seamless persistent logging with button transformation feedback
- **Result**: Improved game flow, better action visibility, no lost information

**Development Status**: Action feedback system completely overhauled with production-ready persistent logging and restored button transformation behavior.
