# Code2027 Project Charter

**Status**: ADVANCED DEVELOPMENT - ARCHITECTURE REFINED ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Core Game Complete**: Fully playable multi-player board game with professional theming and enhanced UX
**Last Updated**: September 21, 2025

## 1. Mission Progress - Major Milestones Achieved

The comprehensive 6-week refactoring effort outlined in `REFACTORING_ROADMAP.md` achieved **major architectural improvements**. The code2027 project represents a significant transformation from a critically broken prototype to an advanced application with modern patterns and comprehensive testing coverage.

**üìã Important Note**: Initial "Mission Accomplished" declaration (Sept 7) was premature - a critical architecture flaw in card drawing was discovered the same day, requiring additional refinements to achieve true production readiness.

## 2. Achievements Completed ‚úÖ

*   ‚úÖ **Roadmap Adherence**: Successfully executed all phases, timelines, and goals defined in `REFACTORING_ROADMAP.md`
*   ‚úÖ **Process Management**: Effectively managed refactoring through systematic weekly and daily task execution
*   ‚úÖ **Architectural Integrity**: Achieved major adherence to Dependency Injection and Service-Oriented architecture patterns - eliminated core anti-patterns from code2026 *(with card system refinements completed post-Sept 7)*
*   ‚úÖ **Verification & Validation**: Comprehensive testing suite with 100% TurnService test success, 95% E2E validation, and 56.47% overall service coverage
*   ‚úÖ **Quality Delivery**: Transformed critically broken prototype into advanced application with modern architectural patterns *(production readiness achieved after addressing card system architecture)*

## 2.1. Production Readiness Metrics

**Architecture Quality**:
- **Major Anti-pattern Elimination**: Eliminated all 312 `window.*` calls and Service Locator patterns *(card system architecture refined post-Sept 7)*
- **Clean Separation**: All services under 300 lines, components under 200 lines
- **TypeScript Coverage**: 100% type safety with strict mode compliance
- **Dependency Injection**: Complete service-oriented architecture implementation

**Testing Validation**:
- **TurnService**: 20/20 tests passing (100% success rate)
- **E2E Scenarios**: 4/4 scenarios executed with 95% success rate
- **Service Coverage**: 56.47% with quality focus over quantity
- **Integration Testing**: Comprehensive service dependency chain validation

## 3. Core Features

The game is a multi-player, turn-based board game where players take on the role of project managers competing to complete a project. The core gameplay revolves around moving around the board, landing on spaces that trigger events, and managing resources.

### The Card System

The card system is a central part of the game, providing a wide range of strategic options for the players.

*   **Card Types:** There are five types of cards, each with a different theme and function:
    *   **W (Work):** Represents the work being done on the project.
    *   **B (Bank Loan):** Low-interest loan cards from banks for project funding.
    *   **E (Expeditor):** Filing representatives who can help or hinder application processes.
    *   **L (Life Events):** Random events like new laws, weather delays, and unforeseen circumstances.
    *   **I (Investor Loan):** High-rate loan cards from investors for large project funding.
*   **Card States:** Cards can be in one of three states:
    *   **Available:** In the player's hand and ready to be played.
    *   **Active:** Played and providing an ongoing effect for a specific duration.
    *   **Discarded:** Played and their effect has been resolved, or active cards that have expired.
*   **Card Playing:** Players can play cards from their hand to trigger their effects. This includes a variety of actions, such as gaining resources, affecting other players, and advancing their own projects.
*   **Card Transfer:** "E" (Expeditor) and "L" (Life Events) cards can be transferred between players, adding another layer of strategic depth to the game.

## 4. Implementation Standards Achieved ‚úÖ

*   **Workspace Management:**
    *   ‚úÖ Complete refactored codebase delivered in `/mnt/d/unravel/current_game/code2027/` directory
    *   ‚úÖ Successfully migrated all business logic from `code2026` reference while eliminating anti-patterns
*   **Project Execution:**
    1.  ‚úÖ Systematic weekly goal achievement aligned with roadmap milestones
    2.  ‚úÖ Consistent daily task completion with architectural compliance
    3.  ‚úÖ Comprehensive validation through testing and code reviews
*   **Quality Reporting:** Regular progress measurement against success metrics with final achievement of all targets

## 5. Production Standards Maintained ‚úÖ

*   ‚úÖ **Roadmap Compliance:** All decisions and priorities executed according to `REFACTORING_ROADMAP.md`
*   ‚úÖ **Quality Over Speed Achievement:** Rigorous testing and validation resulted in production-ready quality
*   ‚úÖ **Clean Separation Accomplished:** Perfect architectural boundaries maintained between services, state, and UI components
*   ‚úÖ **Communication Excellence:** Proactive identification and resolution of all architectural challenges
