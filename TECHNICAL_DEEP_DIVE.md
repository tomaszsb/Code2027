# Technical Deep Dive: Code2027 Project

**Objective:** Transform the critically broken `code2026` prototype into a robust, scalable, and maintainable application (`code2027`) by eliminating severe technical debt and implementing modern software architecture patterns.

**CRITICAL PRINCIPLE**: Build clean, service-oriented architecture with dependency injection. The `code2026` reference codebase contains anti-patterns - study it to understand what NOT to do.

## ‚úÖ Architecture Patterns (Current Implementation)

### Core Services (ALL 14 IMPLEMENTED):
```typescript
DataService.ts           // ‚úÖ CSV data access with caching
StateService.ts          // ‚úÖ Immutable game state management
TurnService.ts           // ‚úÖ Turn progression + win conditions
CardService.ts           // ‚úÖ Card operations + validation
PlayerActionService.ts   // ‚úÖ Command orchestration
MovementService.ts       // ‚úÖ Movement logic + validation
GameRulesService.ts      // ‚úÖ Business rules + validation
EffectEngineService.ts   // ‚úÖ Unified effect processing
ResourceService.ts       // ‚úÖ Resource management
ChoiceService.ts         // ‚úÖ Player choice handling
NegotiationService.ts    // ‚úÖ Player interactions
NotificationService.ts   // ‚úÖ Unified notifications
TargetingService.ts      // ‚úÖ Multi-player targeting
LoggingService.ts        // ‚úÖ Centralized logging
```

### Key Patterns to Follow:
- **Dependency Injection**: `constructor(private serviceA: IServiceA)`
- **Immutable State**: `return { ...player, ...changes }`
- **Service Integration**: `const { dataService } = useGameContext()`
- **TypeScript Strict**: All code fully typed with interfaces
- **‚úÖ PRODUCTION STATUS**: `npm run typecheck` passes with 0 errors (Sept 2025)
- **üìã DEVELOPMENT FOCUS**: Code Building Optimized prioritization (Sept 5, 2025)

## üìÇ Data Architecture

**CRITICAL**: Game loads CSV data from `/public/data/CLEAN_FILES/` directory (not root `/data/`)

### CSV Files (COMPLETE):
- `GAME_CONFIG.csv` - Space configuration, phases, starting positions
- `MOVEMENT.csv` - Space-to-space connections and movement rules
- `CARDS.csv` - 24 cards with types, costs, and effects
- `SPACE_CONTENT.csv` - UI text and story content
- `SPACE_EFFECTS.csv` + `DICE_EFFECTS.csv` - Game effects and mechanics
- `DICE_OUTCOMES.csv` - Dice roll destination mapping

### Data Access Pattern:
```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Always use DataService
const cards = dataService.getCardsByType('W');
const config = dataService.getGameConfigBySpace(spaceName);

// ‚ùå NEVER: Direct CSV access or hardcoded data
```

## üÉè Card System Architecture

The card system is a core component of the game's mechanics. It is designed to be robust, extensible, and easy to maintain.

### Card Service (`CardService.ts`)

The `CardService` is the heart of the card system. It is responsible for all business logic related to cards, including:

*   **Playing Cards:** The `playCard` method is the main entry point for playing a card. It handles validation, effect application, and state changes.
*   **Card State Management:** The service correctly handles the different states of a card:
    *   **Available:** Cards that are in the player's hand and can be played.
    *   **Active:** Cards that have been played and have an ongoing effect with a specific duration.
    *   **Discarded:** Cards that have been played and their effect has been resolved, or active cards that have expired.
*   **Card Expiration:** The `endOfTurn` method is called by the `TurnService` at the end of each turn to process card expirations.
*   **Card Transfer:** The `transferCard` method allows players to give "E" (Expeditor) and "L" (Life Events) cards to other players.

### Card-Related Components

*   **`CardPortfolioDashboard.tsx`:** This component provides a comprehensive view of the player's card portfolio, including their available, active, and discarded cards.
*   **`CardDetailsModal.tsx`:** This modal component displays the full details of a selected card, including its name, description, effects, cost, duration, and phase restriction. It also provides the UI for the card transfer functionality.

### Game Log & Action Feedback System

*   **`GameLog.tsx`:** A persistent scrollable component at the bottom of the game layout that displays all player actions in real-time. Features player-specific color coding, timestamps, and comprehensive action formatting with icons.
*   **`actionLogFormatting.ts`:** Shared utility for consistent action description formatting across components, providing icon-based categorization (üé≤ dice, üé¥ cards, ‚ö° effects, üìç movement).
*   **Action Feedback Architecture:** The game uses a dual-feedback system with immediate button transformation showing completion messages and permanent logging to the global action history for comprehensive game tracking.

## Development Standards & Guidelines

## üèóÔ∏è Code Quality Standards

### File Size Enforcement:
- **Components**: <1,000 lines (prefer <400 lines) - Break down into smaller, focused components when practical
- **Services**: <300 lines (split if larger into focused services)
- **Utilities**: <150 lines (single-purpose functions)
- **Tests**: No limit (comprehensive coverage required)

### Architecture Quality Checklist:
- [x] No `window.*` access anywhere (use dependency injection)
- [x] All dependencies injected via props/constructor
- [x] TypeScript types for all interfaces and function signatures
- [ ] Unit tests for all business logic
- [ ] Component tests for all UI components
*NOTE: Current service test coverage is 56.47%, which is below the 90%+ project goal. A "Test Coverage Improvement" phase is required.*
- [x] File size limits respected
- [x] Single responsibility principle followed
- [x] CSV data accessed only through DataService

### Component Development Guidelines:
- **Single Responsibility**: UI rendering only, no business logic
- **Props-Based Data**: All data via props, no global state access
- **TypeScript Required**: All props and state fully typed
- **Service Integration**: Use `useGameContext()` hook for service access
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with user feedback

### Service Development Guidelines:
- **Dependency Injection**: Constructor-based injection of dependencies
- **Interface Contracts**: Implement defined interfaces from ServiceContracts.ts
- **Immutable Patterns**: Return new objects, never mutate existing state
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch with meaningful error messages
- **Testing**: 90%+ test coverage with both success and error scenarios

## ü™µ Centralized Logging Architecture

To ensure robust debugging and clear game history, a centralized logging architecture has been implemented, revolving around the `LoggingService` and its integration with the `EffectEngineService`.

### Core Components

1.  **`LoggingService`**: A dedicated service responsible for formatting, categorizing, and persisting all game log entries. It is the single source of truth for game history.
2.  **`LOG` Effect Type**: A standardized `Effect` object used to represent a loggable event. This allows any part of the system to generate a log entry in a structured way.
3.  **`EffectEngineService` Integration**: The `EffectEngineService` now treats `LOG` effects as a core part of its processing pipeline. It is responsible for enriching the log payload with contextual information.

### Data Flow

```typescript
// Event Source -> LOG Effect -> EffectEngine -> LoggingService -> GameState

// 1. An action creates a LOG effect
const logEffect: Effect = {
  effectType: 'LOG',
  payload: {
    message: 'Player completed action',
    level: 'INFO',
    source: 'TurnService'
  }
};

// 2. The EffectEngine receives the effect with context
// context = { playerId: 'player1', metadata: {...} }
await effectEngineService.processEffect(logEffect, context);

// 3. EffectEngine enriches the payload and calls LoggingService
this.loggingService.info(
  'Player completed action', 
  { playerId: 'player1', playerName: 'Tomas', source: 'TurnService', ... }
);

// 4. LoggingService creates the final ActionLogEntry and saves it to the global log
stateService.logToActionHistory(logEntry);
```

### Key Benefits

- **Player Attribution**: By enriching the log payload within the `EffectEngine`, all logs are now correctly attributed to the player who initiated the event, eliminating generic "SYSTEM" entries.
- **Context-Rich Logs**: The log payload includes the source of the event, player details, and any other metadata passed in the `EffectContext`, providing a comprehensive record for debugging.
- **Decoupled & Centralized**: Components and services don't need to know about the `GameLog` or how to format messages. They simply fire a `LOG` effect, and the engine and logging service handle the rest.

## üöÄ The Unified Effect Engine
The **Unified Effect Engine** is the crown achievement of the code2027 refactor. It represents a complete paradigm shift from the fragmented, ad-hoc game logic of code2026 to a centralized, standardized system for handling all game events.

### Core Concept

All game events in code2027 - whether triggered by cards, spaces, dice rolls, or player actions - are translated into standardized `Effect` objects. This creates a single, unified pipeline for processing all game logic, eliminating code duplication and ensuring consistent behavior across all game mechanics.

```typescript
// Data Flow: Event Source -> EffectFactory -> Effect[] -> EffectEngineService -> State Change

Card Play Event     ‚Üí  EffectFactory  ‚Üí  [ResourceChangeEffect, CardDrawEffect]  ‚Üí  EffectEngineService  ‚Üí  Player State Update
Space Entry Event   ‚Üí  EffectFactory  ‚Üí  [MovementChoiceEffect, TimeEffect]     ‚Üí  EffectEngineService  ‚Üí  Game State Update  
Dice Roll Event     ‚Üí  EffectFactory  ‚Üí  [TurnControlEffect]                    ‚Üí  EffectEngineService  ‚Üí  Turn State Update
```

### The Three Key Components

#### 1. **EffectFactory** (`src/utils/EffectFactory.ts`)
**Role**: Converts raw game data into standardized Effect objects, decoupling the engine from data sources.

```typescript
// Transforms CSV data into executable effects
EffectFactory.createEffectsFromSpaceEffects(spaceEffects, context)
EffectFactory.createEffectsFromCardData(cardData, playerId)
EffectFactory.createEffectsFromDiceEffects(diceEffects, context)
```

The EffectFactory eliminates the need for the engine to understand CSV structures, card formats, or data schemas. It acts as a translation layer, ensuring that all game data - regardless of source - becomes a consistent array of Effect objects.

#### 2. **Effect Types** (Discriminated Union Pattern)
**Role**: Standardized data structures representing all possible game actions.

The system defines **10 core Effect types** using TypeScript's discriminated union pattern:

```typescript
type Effect = 
  | ResourceChangeEffect     // Money, time, reputation changes
  | CardDrawEffect          // Drawing cards from decks  
  | CardDiscardEffect       // Discarding cards from hand (NEW: runtime card selection)
  | CardActivationEffect    // Activating cards with duration
  | PlayerMovementEffect    // Player movement between spaces
  | TurnControlEffect       // Turn skipping, extra turns
  | ChoiceEffect           // Player choice dialogs
  | EffectGroupTargeted     // Multi-player targeting effects
  | ConditionalEffect      // üé≤ NEW: Dice roll conditional logic
  | RecalculateScopeEffect  // Project scope recalculation for W cards
```

Each effect type carries all necessary data for execution, creating a self-contained instruction set that the engine can process uniformly.

#### 3. **EffectEngineService** (`src/services/EffectEngineService.ts`)
**Role**: Central processor that executes Effect arrays by calling appropriate low-level services.

```typescript
// Single entry point for all game logic
await effectEngineService.executeEffects(effects, context);

// Internally routes to specialized services:
// ResourceChangeEffect    ‚Üí ResourceService.adjustResource()
// CardDrawEffect          ‚Üí CardService.drawCards()  
// MovementChoiceEffect    ‚Üí MovementService + ChoiceService
// TurnControlEffect       ‚Üí TurnService.setTurnModifier()
// RecalculateScopeEffect  ‚Üí GameRulesService.calculateProjectScope()
```

The EffectEngineService acts as an orchestration layer, taking arrays of Effect objects and systematically executing them through the appropriate domain services (ResourceService, CardService, etc.).

### Benefits Achieved

1. **Centralized Logic**: All game mechanics flow through a single, testable pipeline
2. **Data Independence**: Game logic is completely decoupled from CSV structures
3. **Consistent Behavior**: All events follow the same execution patterns
4. **Easy Extension**: New effect types can be added without changing existing code
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Single engine can be tested against all game scenarios

This architecture transformation eliminated the Service Locator anti-patterns, God Objects, and event spaghetti that plagued code2026, replacing them with a clean, predictable, and maintainable system.

## üé≤ Conditional Effects System (Latest Feature)

The **Conditional Effects System** extends the Unified Effect Engine with dice roll-based conditional logic, enabling cards with outcomes that depend on dice roll results. This system handles the 14 cards in the CSV data that use "Roll a die. On X-Y [effect]. On Z-W [effect]." mechanics.

### Architecture Components

#### 1. **CONDITIONAL_EFFECT Type Structure**
```typescript
{
  effectType: 'CONDITIONAL_EFFECT';
  payload: {
    playerId: string;
    condition: {
      type: 'DICE_ROLL';
      ranges: Array<{
        min: number;      // e.g., 1
        max: number;      // e.g., 3
        effects: Effect[]; // Effects to execute if dice matches range
      }>;
    };
    source?: string;
    reason?: string;
  };
}
```

#### 2. **Conditional Effect Parsing (EffectFactory)**
The `parseConditionalEffect()` method uses regex pattern matching to convert card descriptions into structured conditional effects:

```typescript
// Pattern Detection
Input:  "Roll a die. On 1-3 increase filing time by 5 ticks. On 4-6 no effect."
Regex:  /On (\d+)-(\d+)\s+([^.]+)\./g

// Range Extraction  
Range 1: { min: 1, max: 3, effects: [ResourceChangeEffect(+5 TIME)] }
Range 2: { min: 4, max: 6, effects: [] } // "no effect" = empty array
```

**Supported Effect Text Patterns:**
- `"increase ... by X ticks"` ‚Üí `+X TIME` ResourceChangeEffect
- `"reduce/decrease ... by X ticks"` ‚Üí `-X TIME` ResourceChangeEffect  
- `"no effect"` ‚Üí Empty effects array
- **Extensible**: Framework ready for money, card, and other effect types

#### 3. **Conditional Effect Processing (EffectEngineService)**
The engine evaluates dice rolls against condition ranges and recursively processes matching effects:

```typescript
// Runtime Evaluation Flow
1. Receive CONDITIONAL_EFFECT with dice roll in context
2. Evaluate: diceRoll >= range.min && diceRoll <= range.max
3. Find matching range's effects array
4. Recursively call: this.processEffects(matchingEffects, context)
5. Handle "no effect" ranges gracefully (empty array = success)
```

### Integration Features

#### **Context Enhancement**
Extended `EffectContext` with optional `diceRoll?: number` field to pass dice roll results through the effect processing pipeline.

#### **Targeting Compatibility** 
CONDITIONAL_EFFECT is included in targetable effect types, enabling cards like hypothetical "All players roll dice for individual outcomes" mechanics.

#### **Validation Framework**
Comprehensive validation ensures:
- Dice roll presence in context
- Valid range structures (min ‚â§ max)
- Proper effects array structure
- PlayerId validation

### Production Cards Enabled

**14 cards now functional with conditional mechanics:**
```
L009: NIMBY Lawsuit           (1-3: +5 ticks, 4-6: no effect)
L013: Endangered Species      (1-3: +6 ticks, 4-6: no effect)  
L017: Neighborhood Revital.   (1-3: -3 ticks, 4-6: no effect)
L025: Celebrity Endorsement   (1-3: -4 ticks, 4-6: no effect)
L032: Diversity Initiative    (1-3: -2 ticks, 4-6: no effect)
E011: Permit Expedited        (1-3: -4 ticks, 4-6: no effect)
E016: Routine Procedure       (1-3: -1 tick,  4-6: no effect)
E023: On the Radar           (1-3: -2 ticks, 4-6: no effect)
E026: Benefit Verification    (1-3: -2 ticks, 4-6: no effect)
E033: Audit Preparation       (1-3: -2 ticks, 4-6: +2 ticks) ‚≠ê Both outcomes!
```

### Benefits Achieved
1. **Extensible Design**: Framework supports future condition types (player resources, card counts, etc.)
2. **Recursive Integration**: Seamlessly processes conditional outcomes through existing effect pipeline
3. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with discriminated unions and type guards
4. **Performance Optimized**: Early detection prevents unnecessary processing of non-conditional cards
5. **Maintainable**: Centralized parsing logic with clear separation of concerns

## üèõÔ∏è State Management Philosophy

### The Redux Alternative Decision

The original `REFACTORING_ROADMAP.md` considered adopting a formal state management library like Redux, which is a common choice for complex React applications requiring centralized state management. However, after careful architectural analysis, we implemented a **custom StateService** instead.

### Rationale Behind the Custom StateService

#### **1. Simplicity & Control**
Our custom StateService gives us complete control over state management logic without the boilerplate and complexity that accompanies large libraries like Redux. We avoided:
- Action creators, reducers, and middleware setup
- Complex debugging tools and DevTools integration overhead  
- Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with Redux patterns
- Rigid architectural constraints that may not fit our specific use case

```typescript
// Our Simple Approach
stateService.updatePlayer({ id: 'player1', money: 500 });

// vs Redux Approach
dispatch(updatePlayerMoney('player1', 500));
// + action creator + reducer + type definitions
```

#### **2. Performance Optimization**
For our specific board game use case, a simple, observable-based service delivers superior performance:
- **Direct Updates**: No action dispatching overhead or reducer processing chains
- **Targeted Subscriptions**: Components subscribe only to relevant state changes  
- **Minimal Re-renders**: Precise control over when and how components update
- **Memory Efficiency**: No action history, time travel, or debugging overhead in production

#### **3. Dependency-Free Architecture**
Keeping our core state logic free from third-party library dependencies provides several advantages:
- **Future-Proof**: No risk of Redux version conflicts, breaking changes, or library abandonment
- **Bundle Size**: Reduced application bundle size without Redux, React-Redux, and related dependencies
- **Testing Simplicity**: Pure TypeScript service logic is easier to unit test than Redux integration
- **Portability**: StateService could be adapted to other frameworks beyond React if needed

#### **4. Sufficiency for Our Use Case**
Our StateService, combined with React Context API (`useGameContext`), provides comprehensive functionality:

```typescript
// Complete State Management Features Achieved:
‚úÖ Centralized state management through StateService
‚úÖ Immutable state updates with proper type safety  
‚úÖ Component subscriptions via React Context
‚úÖ Real-time UI updates across all components
‚úÖ State validation and business rule enforcement
‚úÖ Easy debugging with straightforward service calls
```

### Implementation Benefits Realized

The custom StateService approach has proven its value throughout development:

1. **Rapid Development**: No learning curve or Redux setup overhead
2. **Clear Debugging**: Direct service calls are easy to trace and debug
3. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration without Redux type complexity
4. **Performance**: Minimal overhead with targeted updates
5. **Maintainability**: Simple, readable code that team members can quickly understand

### Context API Integration

The StateService integrates seamlessly with React's Context API through our `useGameContext()` hook:

```typescript
// Clean Service Access Pattern
const { stateService, cardService, turnService } = useGameContext();

// Direct service calls with full TypeScript support
const player = stateService.getPlayer(playerId);
const result = cardService.playCard(playerId, cardId);
```

This hybrid approach combines the benefits of centralized state management with the simplicity of direct service calls, proving that complex applications don't always require complex state management libraries.

**Conclusion**: The custom StateService decision demonstrates that **architectural choices should be driven by actual requirements rather than popular trends**. For code2027's board game mechanics, our lightweight, purpose-built solution delivers superior performance, maintainability, and developer experience compared to a heavyweight library like Redux.
