# Technical Deep Dive: Code2027 Project

**Objective:** Transform the critically broken `code2026` prototype into a robust, scalable, and maintainable application (`code2027`) by eliminating severe technical debt and implementing modern software architecture patterns.

**CRITICAL PRINCIPLE**: Build clean, service-oriented architecture with dependency injection. The `code2026` reference codebase contains anti-patterns - study it to understand what NOT to do.

## ‚úÖ Architecture Patterns (Current Implementation)

### Core Services (ALL 14 IMPLEMENTED):
```typescript
DataService.ts           // ‚úÖ CSV data access with caching
StateService.ts          // ‚úÖ Immutable game state management
TurnService.ts           // ‚úÖ Turn progression + win conditions
CardService.ts           // ‚úÖ Card operations + validation
PlayerActionService.ts   // ‚úÖ Command orchestration
MovementService.ts       // ‚úÖ Movement logic + validation
GameRulesService.ts      // ‚úÖ Business rules + validation
EffectEngineService.ts   // ‚úÖ Unified effect processing
ResourceService.ts       // ‚úÖ Resource management
ChoiceService.ts         // ‚úÖ Player choice handling
NegotiationService.ts    // ‚úÖ Player interactions
NotificationService.ts   // ‚úÖ Unified notifications
TargetingService.ts      // ‚úÖ Multi-player targeting
LoggingService.ts        // ‚úÖ Centralized logging
```

### Key Patterns to Follow:
- **Dependency Injection**: `constructor(private serviceA: IServiceA)`
- **Immutable State**: `return { ...player, ...changes }`
- **Service Integration**: `const { dataService } = useGameContext()`
- **TypeScript Strict**: All code fully typed with interfaces
- **‚úÖ PRODUCTION STATUS**: `npm run typecheck` passes with 0 errors (Sept 2025)
- **üìã DEVELOPMENT FOCUS**: Code Building Optimized prioritization (Sept 5, 2025)

## üìÇ Data Architecture

**CRITICAL**: Game loads CSV data from `/public/data/CLEAN_FILES/` directory (not root `/data/`)

### CSV Files (COMPLETE):
- `GAME_CONFIG.csv` - Space configuration, phases, starting positions
- `MOVEMENT.csv` - Space-to-space connections and movement rules
- `CARDS.csv` - 24 cards with types, costs, and effects
- `SPACE_CONTENT.csv` - UI text and story content
- `SPACE_EFFECTS.csv` + `DICE_EFFECTS.csv` - Game effects and mechanics
- `DICE_OUTCOMES.csv` - Dice roll destination mapping

### Data Access Pattern:
```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Always use DataService
const cards = dataService.getCardsByType('W');
const config = dataService.getGameConfigBySpace(spaceName);

// ‚ùå NEVER: Direct CSV access or hardcoded data
```

---

## üÉè Card System Architecture

The card system is a core component of the game's mechanics. It is designed to be robust, extensible, and easy to maintain.

### Card Service (`CardService.ts`)

The `CardService` is the heart of the card system. It is responsible for all business logic related to cards, including:

*   **Playing Cards:** The `playCard` method is the main entry point for playing a card. It handles validation, effect application, and state changes.
*   **Card State Management:** The service correctly handles the different states of a card:
    *   **Available:** Cards that are in the player's hand and can be played.
    *   **Active:** Cards that have been played and have an ongoing effect with a specific duration.
    *   **Discarded:** Cards that have been played and their effect has been resolved, or active cards that have expired.
*   **Card Expiration:** The `endOfTurn` method is called by the `TurnService` at the end of each turn to process card expirations.
*   **Card Transfer:** The `transferCard` method allows players to give "E" (Expeditor) and "L" (Life Events) cards to other players.

### Card-Related Components

*   **`CardPortfolioDashboard.tsx`:** This component provides a comprehensive view of the player's card portfolio, including their available, active, and discarded cards.
*   **`CardDetailsModal.tsx`:** This modal component displays the full details of a selected card, including its name, description, effects, cost, duration, and phase restriction. It also provides the UI for the card transfer functionality.

### Game Log & Action Feedback System

*   **`GameLog.tsx`:** A persistent scrollable component at the bottom of the game layout that displays all player actions in real-time. Features player-specific color coding, timestamps, and comprehensive action formatting with icons.
*   **`actionLogFormatting.ts`:** Shared utility for consistent action description formatting across components, providing icon-based categorization (üé≤ dice, üé¥ cards, ‚ö° effects, üìç movement).
*   **Action Feedback Architecture:** The game uses a dual-feedback system with immediate button transformation showing completion messages and permanent logging to the global action history for comprehensive game tracking.

## Development Standards & Guidelines

## üèóÔ∏è Code Quality Standards

### File Size Enforcement:
- **Components**: <1,000 lines (prefer <400 lines) - Break down into smaller, focused components when practical
- **Services**: <300 lines (split if larger into focused services)
- **Utilities**: <150 lines (single-purpose functions)
- **Tests**: No limit (comprehensive coverage required)

### Architecture Quality Checklist:
- [x] No `window.*` access anywhere (use dependency injection)
- [x] All dependencies injected via props/constructor
- [x] TypeScript types for all interfaces and function signatures
- [ ] Unit tests for all business logic
- [ ] Component tests for all UI components
*NOTE: Current service test coverage is 56.47%, which is below the 90%+ project goal. A "Test Coverage Improvement" phase is required.*
- [x] File size limits respected
- [x] Single responsibility principle followed
- [x] CSV data accessed only through DataService

### Component Development Guidelines:
- **Single Responsibility**: UI rendering only, no business logic
- **Props-Based Data**: All data via props, no global state access
- **TypeScript Required**: All props and state fully typed
- **Service Integration**: Use `useGameContext()` hook for service access
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with user feedback

### Service Development Guidelines:
- **Dependency Injection**: Constructor-based injection of dependencies
- **Interface Contracts**: Implement defined interfaces from ServiceContracts.ts
- **Immutable Patterns**: Return new objects, never mutate existing state
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch with meaningful error messages
- **Testing**: 90%+ test coverage with both success and error scenarios

## ü™µ Centralized Logging Architecture

To ensure robust debugging and clear game history, a centralized logging architecture has been implemented, revolving around the `LoggingService` and its integration with the `EffectEngineService`.

### Core Components

1.  **`LoggingService`**: A dedicated service responsible for formatting, categorizing, and persisting all game log entries. It is the single source of truth for game history.
2.  **`LOG` Effect Type**: A standardized `Effect` object used to represent a loggable event. This allows any part of the system to generate a log entry in a structured way.
3.  **`EffectEngineService` Integration**: The `EffectEngineService` now treats `LOG` effects as a core part of its processing pipeline. It is responsible for enriching the log payload with contextual information.

### Data Flow

```typescript
// Event Source -> LOG Effect -> EffectEngine -> LoggingService -> GameState

// 1. An action creates a LOG effect
const logEffect: Effect = {
  effectType: 'LOG',
  payload: {
    message: 'Player completed action',
    level: 'INFO',
    source: 'TurnService'
  }
};

// 2. The EffectEngine receives the effect with context
// context = { playerId: 'player1', metadata: {...} }
await effectEngineService.processEffect(logEffect, context);

// 3. EffectEngine enriches the payload and calls LoggingService
this.loggingService.info(
  'Player completed action', 
  { playerId: 'player1', playerName: 'Tomas', source: 'TurnService', ... }
);

// 4. LoggingService creates the final ActionLogEntry and saves it to the global log
stateService.logToActionHistory(logEntry);
```

### Key Benefits

- **Player Attribution**: By enriching the log payload within the `EffectEngine`, all logs are now correctly attributed to the player who initiated the event, eliminating generic "SYSTEM" entries.
- **Context-Rich Logs**: The log payload includes the source of the event, player details, and any other metadata passed in the `EffectContext`, providing a comprehensive record for debugging.
- **Decoupled & Centralized**: Components and services don't need to know about the `GameLog` or how to format messages. They simply fire a `LOG` effect, and the engine and logging service handle the rest.

## üöÄ The Unified Effect Engine
The **Unified Effect Engine** is the crown achievement of the code2027 refactor. It represents a complete paradigm shift from the fragmented, ad-hoc game logic of code2026 to a centralized, standardized system for handling all game events.

### Core Concept

All game events in code2027 - whether triggered by cards, spaces, dice rolls, or player actions - are translated into standardized `Effect` objects. This creates a single, unified pipeline for processing all game logic, eliminating code duplication and ensuring consistent behavior across all game mechanics.

```typescript
// Data Flow: Event Source -> EffectFactory -> Effect[] -> EffectEngineService -> State Change

Card Play Event     ‚Üí  EffectFactory  ‚Üí  [ResourceChangeEffect, CardDrawEffect]  ‚Üí  EffectEngineService  ‚Üí  Player State Update
Space Entry Event   ‚Üí  EffectFactory  ‚Üí  [MovementChoiceEffect, TimeEffect]     ‚Üí  EffectEngineService  ‚Üí  Game State Update  
Dice Roll Event     ‚Üí  EffectFactory  ‚Üí  [TurnControlEffect]                    ‚Üí  EffectEngineService  ‚Üí  Turn State Update
```

### The Three Key Components

#### 1. **EffectFactory** (`src/utils/EffectFactory.ts`)
**Role**: Converts raw game data into standardized Effect objects, decoupling the engine from data sources.

```typescript
// Transforms CSV data into executable effects
EffectFactory.createEffectsFromSpaceEffects(spaceEffects, context)
EffectFactory.createEffectsFromCardData(cardData, playerId)
EffectFactory.createEffectsFromDiceEffects(diceEffects, context)
```

The EffectFactory eliminates the need for the engine to understand CSV structures, card formats, or data schemas. It acts as a translation layer, ensuring that all game data - regardless of source - becomes a consistent array of Effect objects.

#### 2. **Effect Types** (Discriminated Union Pattern)
**Role**: Standardized data structures representing all possible game actions.

The system defines **10 core Effect types** using TypeScript's discriminated union pattern:

```typescript
type Effect = 
  | ResourceChangeEffect     // Money, time, reputation changes
  | CardDrawEffect          // Drawing cards from decks  
  | CardDiscardEffect       // Discarding cards from hand (NEW: runtime card selection)
  | CardActivationEffect    // Activating cards with duration
  | PlayerMovementEffect    // Player movement between spaces
  | TurnControlEffect       // Turn skipping, extra turns
  | ChoiceEffect           // Player choice dialogs
  | EffectGroupTargeted     // Multi-player targeting effects
  | ConditionalEffect      // üé≤ NEW: Dice roll conditional logic
  | RecalculateScopeEffect  // Project scope recalculation for W cards
```

Each effect type carries all necessary data for execution, creating a self-contained instruction set that the engine can process uniformly.

#### 3. **EffectEngineService** (`src/services/EffectEngineService.ts`)
**Role**: Central processor that executes Effect arrays by calling appropriate low-level services.

```typescript
// Single entry point for all game logic
await effectEngineService.executeEffects(effects, context);

// Internally routes to specialized services:
// ResourceChangeEffect    ‚Üí ResourceService.adjustResource()
// CardDrawEffect          ‚Üí CardService.drawCards()  
// MovementChoiceEffect    ‚Üí MovementService + ChoiceService
// TurnControlEffect       ‚Üí TurnService.setTurnModifier()
// RecalculateScopeEffect  ‚Üí GameRulesService.calculateProjectScope()
```

The EffectEngineService acts as an orchestration layer, taking arrays of Effect objects and systematically executing them through the appropriate domain services (ResourceService, CardService, etc.).

### Benefits Achieved

1. **Centralized Logic**: All game mechanics flow through a single, testable pipeline
2. **Data Independence**: Game logic is completely decoupled from CSV structures
3. **Consistent Behavior**: All events follow the same execution patterns
4. **Easy Extension**: New effect types can be added without changing existing code
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Single engine can be tested against all game scenarios

This architecture transformation eliminated the Service Locator anti-patterns, God Objects, and event spaghetti that plagued code2026, replacing them with a clean, predictable, and maintainable system.

## üé≤ Conditional Effects System (Latest Feature)

The **Conditional Effects System** extends the Unified Effect Engine with dice roll-based conditional logic, enabling cards with outcomes that depend on dice roll results. This system handles the 14 cards in the CSV data that use "Roll a die. On X-Y [effect]. On Z-W [effect]." mechanics.

### Architecture Components

#### 1. **CONDITIONAL_EFFECT Type Structure**
```typescript
{
  effectType: 'CONDITIONAL_EFFECT';
  payload: {
    playerId: string;
    condition: {
      type: 'DICE_ROLL';
      ranges: Array<{
        min: number;      // e.g., 1
        max: number;      // e.g., 3
        effects: Effect[]; // Effects to execute if dice matches range
      }>;
    };
    source?: string;
    reason?: string;
  };
}
```

#### 2. **Conditional Effect Parsing (EffectFactory)**
The `parseConditionalEffect()` method uses regex pattern matching to convert card descriptions into structured conditional effects:

```typescript
// Pattern Detection
Input:  "Roll a die. On 1-3 increase filing time by 5 ticks. On 4-6 no effect."
Regex:  /On (\d+)-(\d+)\s+([^.]+)\./g

// Range Extraction  
Range 1: { min: 1, max: 3, effects: [ResourceChangeEffect(+5 TIME)] }
Range 2: { min: 4, max: 6, effects: [] } // "no effect" = empty array
```

**Supported Effect Text Patterns:**
- `"increase ... by X ticks"` ‚Üí `+X TIME` ResourceChangeEffect
- `"reduce/decrease ... by X ticks"` ‚Üí `-X TIME` ResourceChangeEffect  
- `"no effect"` ‚Üí Empty effects array
- **Extensible**: Framework ready for money, card, and other effect types

#### 3. **Conditional Effect Processing (EffectEngineService)**
The engine evaluates dice rolls against condition ranges and recursively processes matching effects:

```typescript
// Runtime Evaluation Flow
1. Receive CONDITIONAL_EFFECT with dice roll in context
2. Evaluate: diceRoll >= range.min && diceRoll <= range.max
3. Find matching range's effects array
4. Recursively call: this.processEffects(matchingEffects, context)
5. Handle "no effect" ranges gracefully (empty array = success)
```

### Integration Features

#### **Context Enhancement**
Extended `EffectContext` with optional `diceRoll?: number` field to pass dice roll results through the effect processing pipeline.

#### **Targeting Compatibility** 
CONDITIONAL_EFFECT is included in targetable effect types, enabling cards like hypothetical "All players roll dice for individual outcomes" mechanics.

#### **Validation Framework**
Comprehensive validation ensures:
- Dice roll presence in context
- Valid range structures (min ‚â§ max)
- Proper effects array structure
- PlayerId validation

### Production Cards Enabled

**14 cards now functional with conditional mechanics:**
```
L009: NIMBY Lawsuit           (1-3: +5 ticks, 4-6: no effect)
L013: Endangered Species      (1-3: +6 ticks, 4-6: no effect)  
L017: Neighborhood Revital.   (1-3: -3 ticks, 4-6: no effect)
L025: Celebrity Endorsement   (1-3: -4 ticks, 4-6: no effect)
L032: Diversity Initiative    (1-3: -2 ticks, 4-6: no effect)
E011: Permit Expedited        (1-3: -4 ticks, 4-6: no effect)
E016: Routine Procedure       (1-3: -1 tick,  4-6: no effect)
E023: On the Radar           (1-3: -2 ticks, 4-6: no effect)
E026: Benefit Verification    (1-3: -2 ticks, 4-6: no effect)
E033: Audit Preparation       (1-3: -2 ticks, 4-6: +2 ticks) ‚≠ê Both outcomes!
```

### Benefits Achieved
1. **Extensible Design**: Framework supports future condition types (player resources, card counts, etc.)
2. **Recursive Integration**: Seamlessly processes conditional outcomes through existing effect pipeline
3. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with discriminated unions and type guards
4. **Performance Optimized**: Early detection prevents unnecessary processing of non-conditional cards
5. **Maintainable**: Centralized parsing logic with clear separation of concerns

## üèõÔ∏è State Management Philosophy

### The Redux Alternative Decision

The original `REFACTORING_ROADMAP.md` considered adopting a formal state management library like Redux, which is a common choice for complex React applications requiring centralized state management. However, after careful architectural analysis, we implemented a **custom StateService** instead.

### Rationale Behind the Custom StateService

#### **1. Simplicity & Control**
Our custom StateService gives us complete control over state management logic without the boilerplate and complexity that accompanies large libraries like Redux. We avoided:
- Action creators, reducers, and middleware setup
- Complex debugging tools and DevTools integration overhead  
- Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with Redux patterns
- Rigid architectural constraints that may not fit our specific use case

```typescript
// Our Simple Approach
stateService.updatePlayer({ id: 'player1', money: 500 });

// vs Redux Approach
dispatch(updatePlayerMoney('player1', 500));
// + action creator + reducer + type definitions
```

#### **2. Performance Optimization**
For our specific board game use case, a simple, observable-based service delivers superior performance:
- **Direct Updates**: No action dispatching overhead or reducer processing chains
- **Targeted Subscriptions**: Components subscribe only to relevant state changes  
- **Minimal Re-renders**: Precise control over when and how components update
- **Memory Efficiency**: No action history, time travel, or debugging overhead in production

#### **3. Dependency-Free Architecture**
Keeping our core state logic free from third-party library dependencies provides several advantages:
- **Future-Proof**: No risk of Redux version conflicts, breaking changes, or library abandonment
- **Bundle Size**: Reduced application bundle size without Redux, React-Redux, and related dependencies
- **Testing Simplicity**: Pure TypeScript service logic is easier to unit test than Redux integration
- **Portability**: StateService could be adapted to other frameworks beyond React if needed

#### **4. Sufficiency for Our Use Case**
Our StateService, combined with React Context API (`useGameContext`), provides comprehensive functionality:

```typescript
// Complete State Management Features Achieved:
‚úÖ Centralized state management through StateService
‚úÖ Immutable state updates with proper type safety  
‚úÖ Component subscriptions via React Context
‚úÖ Real-time UI updates across all components
‚úÖ State validation and business rule enforcement
‚úÖ Easy debugging with straightforward service calls
```

### Implementation Benefits Realized

The custom StateService approach has proven its value throughout development:

1. **Rapid Development**: No learning curve or Redux setup overhead
2. **Clear Debugging**: Direct service calls are easy to trace and debug
3. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration without Redux type complexity
4. **Performance**: Minimal overhead with targeted updates
5. **Maintainability**: Simple, readable code that team members can quickly understand

### Context API Integration

The StateService integrates seamlessly with React's Context API through our `useGameContext()` hook:

```typescript
// Clean Service Access Pattern
const { stateService, cardService, turnService } = useGameContext();

// Direct service calls with full TypeScript support
const player = stateService.getPlayer(playerId);
const result = cardService.playCard(playerId, cardId);
```

## ü™µ Robust Transactional Logging Architecture (September 2025)

**STATUS: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Implementation and Testing Complete**

This section details the implemented transactional logging system, designed to ensure log accuracy in the presence of state-reverting mechanics like "Try Again".

### 1. Problem Statement

The original logging system wrote actions directly to the `globalActionLog`. When a player used the "Try Again" feature, their game state was reverted, but the log was not. This polluted the official game history with actions from "aborted timelines," making the log unreliable for analysis.

### 2. Core Architecture: Dual-Layer Logging ‚úÖ

**IMPLEMENTED**: We use a single log data structure (`globalActionLog`) but create two logical "layers" through metadata. This preserves all data for potential teacher analysis while allowing the student-facing log to remain clean.

-   **`isCommitted: boolean`**: A flag on each log entry. `true` if the action is part of the canonical game history.
-   **`explorationSessionId: string`**: A unique ID that groups all actions from a single exploratory attempt.

The default view of the game log for a student will **only** show entries where `isCommitted: true`.

### 3. Session Lifecycle Management ‚úÖ

**IMPLEMENTED**: The session lifecycle is now properly managed throughout the application:

1.  **`TurnService.startTurn()`**: Calls `loggingService.startNewExplorationSession()`. This generates a **new, unique** session ID and stores it in the `GameState.currentExplorationSessionId`.
2.  **`TurnService.endTurn()` and `TurnService.endTurnWithMovement()`**: Call `loggingService.commitCurrentSession()`. This finds all log entries with the current session ID and flips their `isCommitted` flag to `true`.
3.  **`TurnService.tryAgainOnSpace()`**:
    a. The current exploration session is considered "abandoned" (its entries remain `isCommitted: false`).
    b. A new, committed action is logged to record the "Try Again" event itself with `isCommitted: true`.
    c. A **new exploration session is started immediately** with a fresh session ID for the player's next attempt.

### 4. Implementation Details ‚úÖ

**LoggingService Enhancements:**
- `startNewExplorationSession()`: Creates unique session IDs and updates game state
- `commitCurrentSession()`: Marks all session entries as committed
- `getCurrentSessionId()`: Returns active session ID or null
- `cleanupAbandonedSessions()`: Removes old uncommitted entries (24 hour threshold)

**Enhanced Logging Logic:**
- System logs and error logs are always immediately committed
- Player actions during exploration sessions are uncommitted until turn ends
- Explicit `isCommitted` flag in payload overrides default behavior
- Try Again actions are explicitly marked as committed

### 5. Production Implementation ‚úÖ

**Memory Management**: The `cleanupAbandonedSessions()` method removes uncommitted log entries older than 24 hours, preventing unbounded growth.

**State Consistency**: The `StateService.revertPlayerToSnapshot()` performs complete state rollback while preserving transactional log integrity.

**Testing Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite (`TransactionalLogging.test.ts`) validates:
- Session lifecycle management
- Commit/uncommitted state handling
- Cleanup functionality
- Edge cases and error scenarios

---

## üéØ Turn Numbering System Fix (September 2025)

**STATUS: üìã PLANNED - Architecture Designed, Implementation Pending**

This section outlines the comprehensive solution to fix the confusing and incorrect turn numbering system in the game log.

### 1. Problem Analysis

**Current Issues Identified:**
- **Global turn counter confusion**: `GameState.turn` increments for every player action instead of game rounds
- **System log pollution**: Exploration session management logs cluttering player-visible game log
- **Missing round concept**: No distinction between "game rounds" (all players take turns) vs individual player turns
- **Inconsistent turn context**: Actions show turn numbers that don't match actual game progression

**User Impact:**
```
‚ùå Current Confusing Display:
üë§ System - 15 turns, 15 actions
Turn 1: ‚öôÔ∏è Started exploration session
Turn 2: ‚öôÔ∏è Committed exploration session
Turn 3: ‚öôÔ∏è Started exploration session

üë§ Player 1 - 5 turns, 16 actions
Turn 1: üé≤ Rolled dice
Turn 2: ‚öôÔ∏è Used Try Again
Turn 3: ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Turn 2 started (???)
```

### 2. Proposed Turn Tracking Architecture ‚úÖ

**Enhanced GameState Structure:**
```typescript
interface GameState {
  // New turn tracking system
  gameRound: number;           // Current game round (1, 2, 3...)
  turnWithinRound: number;     // Current turn within round (1-4 for 4 players)
  globalTurnCount: number;     // Total turns taken (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...)

  // Legacy field (deprecated)
  turn: number;                // Keep for backwards compatibility
}
```

**Enhanced ActionLogEntry Structure:**
```typescript
interface ActionLogEntry {
  // Existing fields...

  // Enhanced turn context
  gameRound: number;           // Which game round this occurred in
  turnWithinRound: number;     // Which turn within that round
  globalTurnNumber: number;    // Absolute turn number

  // Visibility control
  visibility: 'player' | 'debug' | 'system';  // Who should see this log
}
```

### 3. Turn Progression Logic ‚úÖ

**4-Player Game Example:**
```
Game Round 1:
  - Player 1: Turn 1 (Global Turn 1)
  - Player 2: Turn 2 (Global Turn 2)
  - Player 3: Turn 3 (Global Turn 3)
  - Player 4: Turn 4 (Global Turn 4)

Game Round 2:
  - Player 1: Turn 1 (Global Turn 5)
  - Player 2: Turn 2 (Global Turn 6)
  - Player 3: Turn 3 (Global Turn 7)
  - Player 4: Turn 4 (Global Turn 8)
```

### 4. Enhanced Game Log Display ‚úÖ

**Target User Experience:**
```
‚úÖ Clear, Hierarchical Display:
üìú Game Log (46 entries, 4 players)

üéØ Game Round 1
  üë§ Player 1 (Turn 1)
    üé≤ Rolled a 7
    üÉè Drew 2 cards
    üìç Moved to SPACE-A2

  üë§ Player 2 (Turn 2)
    üé≤ Rolled a 4
    üîÑ Used Try Again
    üé≤ Rolled a 6 (retry)
    üìç Moved to SPACE-B1

üéØ Game Round 2
  üë§ Player 1 (Turn 3)
    ...
```

### Architectural Patterns Established üèóÔ∏è

The recent work has successfully established key architectural patterns that resolve the critical gaps identified in the audit:

#### **1. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) - PROVEN**
```typescript
// Clean service orchestration established
PlayerActionService ‚Üí DataService + StateService + GameRulesService
```
- **Single Responsibility:** Each service has a focused, well-defined role
- **Dependency Injection:** All services receive dependencies via constructor
- **Interface Contracts:** Proper TypeScript interfaces define service boundaries
- **Testability:** Services can be tested in isolation with mocked dependencies

#### **2. UI-to-Service Communication Pattern - ESTABLISHED**
```typescript
// Pattern now established for all future UI components
const { playerActionService, stateService } = useGameContext();

const handleAction = async () => {
  try {
    await playerActionService.someAction(params);
    // Handle success
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle error with user feedback
  }
};
```
- **Hook-Based Access:** useGameContext() provides clean service access
- **Async Error Handling:** Consistent try-catch with user feedback
- **State Integration:** Automatic UI updates through service state changes
- **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript coverage from UI to services

#### **3. Data-Driven Architecture - IMPLEMENTED**
```typescript
// CSV data properly integrated throughout stack
DataService.loadCards() ‚Üí Card[] ‚Üí PlayerActionService.playCard() ‚Üí UI Updates
```
- **Single Source of Truth:** All card data comes from CSV files
- **Validation Pipeline:** Data validated at load time and usage time
- **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript types from CSV to UI
- **Error Resilience:** Comprehensive error handling at each layer

#### **4. Testing Strategy - PROVEN**
```typescript
// Comprehensive testing patterns established
- Service Unit Tests: Mock dependencies, test business logic
- Integration Tests: Verify service interactions
- Component Tests: Mock useGameContext, test UI integration
```
- **Mock-Based Testing:** Clean isolation with jest mocks
- **Error Scenario Coverage:** Test both success and failure paths
- **Service Contract Testing:** Verify interface compliance
- **Integration Validation:** Test service interaction patterns

## üß™ Testing Framework Achievements - August 31, 2025

### **TurnService Test Suite - 100% Success Achievement**

Successfully completed comprehensive testing framework validation with **20/20 TurnService tests passing**.

#### **Critical Integration Test Fixes**

**1. Property Structure Modernization** ‚úÖ
```typescript
// BEFORE: Deprecated structure causing test failures
mockPlayer: { cards: { W: ['W_1'] } }

// AFTER: Current structure enabling test success
mockPlayer: { availableCards: { W: ['W_1'] } }
```

**2. Sophisticated Mock Implementation Patterns** ‚úÖ
```typescript
// Established pattern for realistic effect simulation
mockEffectEngineService.processEffects.mockImplementation(async (effects, context) => {
  // Simulate realistic business logic
  const player = mockStateService.getPlayer('player1');
  if (player && player.money > 0) {
    const feeAmount = Math.floor(player.money * 0.05);
    mockStateService.updatePlayer({ id: 'player1', money: player.money - feeAmount });
  }
  return { success: true, totalEffects: effects.length, ... };
});
```

#### **Testing Architecture Validation**

**Service Dependency Chain Verification** ‚úÖ
- **TurnService ‚Üî EffectEngineService**: Circular dependency resolved via setter injection
- **Effect Processing Pipeline**: EffectFactory ‚Üí EffectEngine ‚Üí StateService flow validated
- **Mock Sophistication**: Integration tests simulate realistic business logic vs simple stubs

**Test Pattern Establishment** ‚úÖ
- **Realistic Mocks**: Business logic simulation over trivial return values
- **Property Consistency**: All tests using current data structures (`availableCards`)
- **Integration Focus**: Testing service interactions, not just isolated units

#### **Production Readiness Confirmation**

The 100% test success rate provides:
- ‚úÖ **Confidence in Service Integration**: Complex dependency chains working correctly
- ‚úÖ **Regression Prevention**: Tests catch property/interface changes
- ‚úÖ **Mock Pattern Library**: Established patterns for future test development
- ‚úÖ **Architecture Validation**: Confirms clean separation of concerns

**Result**: Robust testing foundation supporting ongoing development with proven mock patterns for complex service interactions.
