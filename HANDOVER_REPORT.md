## 🐛 Recent Bug Fixes (October 3, 2025)

### **1. Per_200K Calculation Fix**
**Problem**: BANK-FUND-REVIEW space effect was adding fixed value (1 time) instead of scaling by loan amount.

**Solution**: Implemented proper calculation in `TurnService.ts`:
```typescript
const totalBorrowed = player.loans?.reduce((sum, loan) => sum + loan.principal, 0) || 0;
const multiplier = Math.floor(totalBorrowed / 200000);
additionalTime = value * multiplier;
```

**Location**: `TurnService.ts:1199-1247` (money effects) and `1242-1254` (time effects)

**Impact**: Space effects now correctly scale with loan amounts (e.g., $600K loan = 3 time added, not 1).

---

### **2. Snapshot Timing Fix**
**Problem**: Try Again snapshots were saved BEFORE processing space effects, causing first-visit effects to be skipped.

**Solution**: Moved `savePreSpaceEffectSnapshot()` to AFTER `processSpaceEffectsAfterMovement()` in `TurnService.startTurn()`.

**Location**: `TurnService.ts:502-505`

**Impact**: First-visit space effects now process correctly while maintaining Try Again functionality.

**Verification**: All E2E tests pass with no regressions.

---

### **3. Turn Numbering System Overhaul**
**Problem**: Confusing turn numbering, system logs cluttering UI, inconsistent turn display.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Backend: Migrated to `globalTurnCount` system, removed deprecated `turn` property
- Frontend: Grouped player turns into collapsible rounds in `GameLog.tsx`
- Notifications: Updated to use `globalTurnCount` throughout

**Files Modified**: `StateService.ts`, `TurnService.ts`, `GameLog.tsx`

**Testing**: All 23 TurnService tests + E2E tests passing

---

### **4. Game Log & Turn Sequence Architecture**
**Problem**: Out-of-sequence game logs, duplicate entries, confusing first-turn initialization.

**Architectural Principles Implemented**:
1. **"The Log Follows the Logic"** - Game log accurately reflects state machine sequence
2. **Unified Turn Start** - Single `TurnService.startTurn()` controls all turn beginnings
3. **Intelligent Centralized Logging** - `LoggingService` infers correct log types
4. **Data-Driven UI** - `GameLog.tsx` renders based on chronological action log

**Impact**: Clean, sequential, intuitive game log with proper turn flow.

## 🧪 Test Suite Status

### **Overall Metrics**
- **617 tests passing** (100% success rate)
- **0 tests failing**
- **0 tests skipped**
- **52 test files** covering all components and services

### **Coverage Breakdown**
- **Services**: >90% coverage (all business logic validated)
- **Components**: UI logic and rendering tested with mocked services
- **E2E Tests**: Integration flows and gameplay scenarios
- **Utilities**: Helper functions and pure logic tested

### **Test Infrastructure**
- **Configuration**: Single-fork execution for stability (`vitest.config.dev.ts`)
- **Cleanup Strategy**: Automatic DOM cleanup prevents test contamination
- **Batch Execution**: Organized via `run-tests-batch-fixed.sh` for systematic validation
