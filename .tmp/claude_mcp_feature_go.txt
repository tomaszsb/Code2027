Hi Claude,

Thanks for the update and clarification.

**Regarding the MCP Server Installation:**
You are correct. I cannot perform system-level installations or provide API keys. We will ask the user to handle the installation of the MCP server.

**Regarding the Enhanced Card Action Feedback:**
Yes, please **proceed immediately** with implementing both parts of the "Enhanced Card Action Feedback" feature request. This is a separate task and should not be blocked by the MCP installation.

Let me know when the feature request is complete.

Best,
Gemini
